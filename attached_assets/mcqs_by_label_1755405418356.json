        ],
        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Nipple discharge is surgically significant when it is grossly bloody and when it appears at a single duct orifice on one nipple. Bloody discharge is usually due to a benign intraductal papilloma; however, intraductal carcinoma in the large ducts under the nipple can be the cause of bloody discharge, and pathologically the lesion is frequently a large papillary tumor that has become malignant. Paget's disease of the nipple is also due to intraductal carcinoma arising in subareolar ducts, but it rarely is associated with nipple discharge. Subareolar mastitis may produce nipple discharge, but it is purulent and not bloody. Inflammatory carcinoma is not associated with nipple discharge.",

Papillomatosis is also part of the fibrocystic complex and is a frequent finding in benign breast biopsies; it does not confer an increased risk of cancer.",

Infiltrating lobular cancer is a particular histologic variant of invasive breast cancer characterized by permeation of the stroma with small cells that resemble those found in the breast lobule or acinus. Intraductal carcinoma refers to a malignancy of ductal origin that remains enclosed within duct structures. This noninvasive proliferation can undergo central necrosis, which frequently calcifies to form the microcalcifications seen on mammography. The central necrosis within enlarged and back-to-back ductal structures resembles comedoes and gives rise to the term “comedocarcinoma,” now reserved for this histologic variety of intraductal carcinoma.",

          "C"
        ],
        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The most important risk factors for breast cancer are the patient's age, gender, and a family history of breast cancer in immediate relatives (sisters, mother, daughter). The age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer increases with age. Breast cancer does occur in males, but the disease is far more common in women. Family history is important when breast cancer occurs within the immediate family; history of breast cancer in more distant relatives (grandmothers, cousins, aunts) is less important. In addition, age factors into the risk associated with family history. An affected young primary relative is far more significant as a risk factor than an older relative with breast cancer. The other important risk factor not listed here is a history of breast cancer, either within the conserved ipsilateral breast or in the contralateral breast. Again, age plays an important modifying role; as the age at which breast cancer was first diagnosed increases, the risk of a subsequent second cancer decreases. Although patients with fibrocystic disease are at increased risk for breast cancer, risk concentrates in those patients with fibrocystic disease who show atypical epithelial hyperplasia within breast ducts. Obesity, nulliparity, and alcohol all appear to increase risk slightly and are important to the epidemiologic study of breast cancer; however, the effect of these factors is not sufficient to warrant their use in common clinical practice.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The only firm contraindication to wide excision and radiation (breast preservation, lumpectomy) as the primary surgical treatment for a newly discovered breast cancer is the inability to achieve an uninvolved surgical margin after excision of the tumor. A positive surgical margin requires, at least, reoperation with an attempt at re-excision of the cancer. If the margin of removal is positive after attempts at re-excision, this is a strong reason to recommend mastectomy in preference to breast conservation. Tumor size is a relative contraindication when the cancer is so large in relation to the breast that excision to a clean surgical margin seems unreasonable. Other histologic findings, such as tumor grade or vascular invasion, are not strong reasons to recommend mastectomy if the patient would prefer breast conservation.",

Lymph node dissection is not routinely required for a pure in situ cancer of the breast. In contrast, all of the other cancers listed above (infiltrating lobular, infiltrating ductal, and medullary carcinoma) are invasive malignancies that are capable of nodal and distant metastasis. Lymph node dissection is commonly recommended for these invasive malignancies. Intraductal lesions that have grown larger than 5 cm. are more apt to have become focally invasive. Since this invasive component might be missed histologically, many surgeons advocate selective use of axillary node dissection for large intraductal lesions, particularly high-grade tumors such as the comedo variant. However, a purely intraductal 2-cm. cancer would most likely be treated without performing node dissection.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Retrospective reviews and prospective surgical trials agree that omission of breast radiation after wide excision leads to a higher rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence. However, survival and the risk of distant disease are not altered in patients treated by excision alone, within the follow-up time of the studies and given their inherent power to detect differences in outcome. Regional node metastasis is not affected by the choice of mastectomy versus wide excision and radiation.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The treatment approach to intraductal carcinoma depends on the extent of the disease, its multifocality, and the involvement of the surgical margin. For extensive disease, modified radical mastectomy is appropriate, particularly if there is a great likelihood of occult invasive disease, making axillary dissection logical. For small foci of disease excised to clear surgical margins, observation is an acceptable recommendation to a well-informed patient. Several noncontrolled reviews and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial for intraductal disease would indicate a greater chance of ipsilateral breast recurrence for lumpectomy only; however, the magnitude of the risk is small, and survival is excellent and unaffected. The only mode of treatment that cannot be recommended for routine management is leaving residual disease in the breast and treating only with radiation.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: LCIS is best thought of as a precursor lesion that confers increased risk for eventual cancer. The magnitude of this risk appears to be in the range of seven- to ninefold over baseline risk. The chance of breast cancer is equal in both breasts, not just in the biopsied breast, and the type of cancer is not confined to a lobular histology. After a diagnosis of LCIS, patients are at increased risk for invasive and noninvasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts. Therefore, mirror-image biopsy as practiced in the past has little to offer. Since LCIS is purely noninvasive, nodal dissection is not required if mastectomy is chosen. There are no data on the use of breast radiation therapy for LCIS. Most surgical oncologists recommend close follow-up for patients who have LCIS only; the alternative surgical treatment that makes most sense is bilateral simple mastectomies, with or without reconstruction.",

          "B"

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: An overview analysis (meta-analysis) examined nearly all randomized clinical trials in which chemotherapy after surgery was compared to surgery alone for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. This examination of the world's published literature revealed that the magnitude of benefit (the reduction in the odds of recurrence) from chemotherapy was relatively small and in the range of a 20% reduction in the chance of recurrence or death; however, this benefit extended to patients of all ages (young and older) and to both node-positive and node-negative patients. The value of adjuvant chemotherapy does not depend on the hormone receptor content of the cancer. It is useful to remember that a constant reduction in the odds of recurrence results in a higher absolute benefit as the prognosis worsens. If the chance of recurrence is 50% (for node-positive groups) the absolute reduction will be in the range of 10% or 15%. In contrast, if the recurrence rate is 10%, the absolute difference between treated and control groups will be less than 5%. This means that many patients need to be exposed to the risks and side effects of chemotherapy to benefit a very small number. This kind of thinking is currently used to decide who should receive adjuvant chemotherapy after primary treatment (mastectomy or lumpectomy).",

A pocket is created beneath the serratus and pectoralis major muscles, extending medially to the perforating internal mammary vessels and inferiorly beneath the fascial insertion of the rectus abdominis muscle. A tissue expander prosthesis is inserted into the pocket. If the patient requires adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, reconstruction of the breast is delayed until treatment is completed and an adequate recovery period has passed. If the quantity or quality of the chest skin or the pectoralis major muscle is insufficient, tissue must be brought in from adjacent areas. A latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap may be transferred on its blood supply via the thoracodorsal artery and vein. Extensive postmastectomy defects necessitate the use of the larger rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, which is based on the superior epigastric vessels. A “free” microvascular rectus abdominis or other myocutaneous flaps may be used. The thoracodorsal or anterior serratus vessels can usually be anastomosed to the inferior epigastric vessels of the rectus abdominis flap.",

Because of the increased weight of the breast considerable shoulder and back pain, accompanied by excoriation of the skin in the inframammary area and the shoulders, can occur. Older women frequently seek relief from these problems, which can be resolved by a reduction mammaplasty. The reduction in breast volume is usually accomplished by moving the nipple and areola on a dermal pedicle flap. The flap can be based inferiorly, medially, superiorly, laterally, vertically, or horizontally. It is possible to remove up to 3000 gm. of breast tissue utilizing a pyramidal-based breast flap with an inferior dermal nipple-areola pedicle since the blood supply to the tissues is preserved by this technique. Breast reduction involving removal of more than 3000 gm. requires a breast amputation technique with immediate free nipple grafting.",

        "explanation": "The breast abuts against the fascia of the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles. Projections of the fascia course through the breast to the skin, forming a supporting framework of the breast parenchyma. These fascial bands, called suspensory ligaments of Cooper, are better developed in the upper breast. The structure of the breast can be divided into lobular and ductal elements. The lobule is the functional unit of the breast. Within a lobule, the terminal elongated tubular ducts are referred to as alveoli. Ten to one hundred alveoli coalesce to form a larger duct which defines a lobular unit. The lobular ducts join to form progressively larger ducts and ultimately an excretory duct. The alveolar ducts, lobular ducts, and excretory ducts are all lined with either cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Eventually, 10-20 excretory ducts, each dilate into a short excretory sinus (lined with squamous epithelium) just beneath the areola. Excretory ducts then course perpendicular to exit through the nipple. The lymphatic anatomy of the breast is of interest to the surgeon because of the tendency of breast cancer to involve the regional lymph nodes. Studies using radioactive tracers demonstrate at least 97% of lymphatic flow from the breast is into the axilla; the remainder courses into the internal mammary nodes. These studies also show that lymph flowing into the internal mammary gland chain is not restricted in origin to the medial half and sub-areolar region of the breast, as was thought, but can originate in any quadrant of the breast. In the axilla, lymphatic vessels terminate in the lymph nodes embedded within the axillary fat pad. Also within the axillary fat pad are the intercostal brachial nerves (a sensory nerve supply in the under arm), the long thoracic nerve (a motor nerve to the serratus anterior and subscapularis muscles) and the thoracodorsal nerve (a motor nerve to the latissimus dorsi adjacent to its accompanying arteries and veins).",

        "explanation": "Although mammography has been available for years, it did not become widely used until the findings of the Health Insurance Plan of New York and the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration project studies of screening mammography were disseminated. These and other investigators demonstrated that 10%–50% of cancers detected mammographically are not palpable. Conversely, palpation recognizes 10%–20% of tumors not detectable mammographically. The incidence of breast cancer begins to rise sharply at age 40, and the sensitivity of mammograms increases with age as the dense parenchymal tissue of young women is progressively replaced by fatty tissue. Routine screening mammography has been shown to decrease breast cancer-related mortality in asymptomatic women over the age of 50. Controversy exists concerning the role of screening in younger woman. However, currently the American Cancer Society recommends that mammographic screening begin at age 40. Although sensitive, mammography is not specific. Only about 25% of nonpalpable lesions detected mammographically are found to be malignant at biopsy. A spiculated density with ill-defined margins on mammogram is almost certainly malignant. Most commonly, features are seen that are suggestive but not diagnostic of cancer. These include clustered microcalcifications, asymmetric density, ductal asymmetry, and distortion of normal breast architecture and/or skin or nipple distortion.",

Any technique used for post-lumpectomy radiation of the breast must adequately cover the volume at risk, deliver a homogenous dose throughout the target tissues, avoid overlapping or inadequate apposition of fields, and minimize the dose reaching the heart and lung. The entire breast should be treated with a total dose of 4500 to 5000 cGy. There is no good evidence to support a radiation boost to the site of the primary tumor. Complications from breast radiation are uncommon if performed correctly. Acute complications of radiotherapy include fatigue, breast edema, and skin erythema; these are almost always self-limited and resolve over weeks (fatigue) 2 months (erythema) or years (edema). The most common long-term problems are rib fractures and minor arm edema, each of which occur about 5% of the time.",

Many breast infections begin as cellulitis, without abscess formation. When an actual abscess is suspected, percutaneous aspiration can establish the diagnosis and allow for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. Open surgical drainage is the most prudent and effective treatment. Although women may choose to cease breast feeding, there is no absolute indication for this. When mastitis or breast infection is suspected clinically, the possibility of an inflammatory carcinoma must also be entertained. Any inflammatory process that does not respond completely and promptly to antibiotics or drainage should be subjected to biopsy to rule out cancer.",

Axillary lymph node metastasis will be found in approximately one-third of clinically negative axillae, but only if proper axillary dissection is performed. Removal of only level I nodes or “sampling” of axillary lymph nodes in a haphazard fashion increases the risk of injury to major axillary neurovascular structures and may understage up to 25% of women. Proper staging of axillary lymph nodes should include en bloc removal and examination of level I and level II nodes. When conducted for staging, axillary lymph node dissection should not include removal of level III axillary nodes; in fewer than 2% are metastases present in level III nodes when level I and level II nodes are negative. Removal of level III nodes, however, does increase the incidence of postoperative arm lymph edema almost fivefold. Therapeutic axillary lymph node dissection performed for palpable disease in the axilla should include removal of all levels to clear gross disease.",

        "explanation": "Breast growth, development, and function are orchestrated by a variety of hormones and growth factors. Estrogen plays a central role in breast development, growth, and differentiation. Lipid-soluble estrogens gain entry to the normal and malignant breast cell by diffusing to the cell membrane. Once within the cell, estrogens bind with the estrogen receptor. Both normal and malignant breast cells contain estrogen receptors, but the low levels of receptors in normal breast tissue and in some breast cancers result in their testing negative in clinical assays. Cyclic changes associated with the menstrual cycle have a profound influence on breast morphology and physiology. During the period of relative quiescence, increasing Graafian follicle secretion of estrogen stimulates breast epithelial proliferation. As the luteal phase of the cycle is entered, progesterone levels rise. Mammary ductal dilatation and differentiation of alveolus epithelial cells into secretory cells result. At the onset of menstruation, the rapid decline of circulating sex-hormone levels leads to breast involution and the cycle begins anew. During pregnancy, marked ductular, lobular, and alveolar growth occur under the influence of estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen, prolactin, and chorionic gonadotropin. These changes prepare the breasts for milk production at parturition. Early in the first trimester, ductal sprouting and lobular formation proceed under estrogenic influence. During the second trimester, lobular events predominate under the influence of progestins. Abrupt withdrawal of placental lactogen and sex-hormones that occurs with delivery, leaves the breast predominately under the influence of pituitary-derived prolactin. Milk production and secretion are maintained during lactation by ongoing secretion of prolactin by the anterior pituitary.",

Response rates are highest in women who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant therapy is not consistently associated with a poorer response to therapy, particularly if a long interval has lapsed between adjuvant therapy and the development of metastases. Endocrine therapy is appropriate as the first-line treatment for nearly all women with ER-positive metastatic breast disease.

Palpation of a mass usually reveals a well-circumscribed, oval or round, mobile mass with a firm, rubbery texture. Because the mammographic appearance of a fibroadenoma is rarely characteristic, mammography plays little role in diagnosing this lesion. Ultrasonography can differentiate a solid mass from a cyst. Additionally, the ultrasonic appearance of a well-marginated, homogenous mass may be sufficiently characteristic to permit diagnosis of fibroadenoma. Excisional biopsy is not necessary for every fibroadenoma. Women under 30 years of age with characteristic physical examination and sonographic appearance of the fibroadenoma may be given the option of observation.

More recently, a mutation has been characterized on the short arm of chromosome 2 in a gene associated with DNA repair. Predisposition to a wide range of malignancies, including breast and colon cancer is associated with abnormalities at this locus. The most exciting development in inherited susceptibility to breast cancer relate to the identification and cloning of the BRCA 1 gene, which was initially localized on the long arm of chromosome 17 by linkage analysis. Germline abnormalities in BRCA a may be responsible for as many as 5% of all breast cancers in the United States. The gene is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with a high degree of penetrance. Almost 60% of women inheriting the gene will develop breast cancer by age 50, and a lifelong risk approaches 85%. Another breast cancer susceptibility gene, dubbed BRCA 2, has been localized by linkage analysis to a small region of chromosome 13q12-13. BRCA 2 apparently confers the high-risk of early onset female breast cancer. Similar to BRCA 1, the lifetime breast cancer risk approaches 90% in carriers of this gene.",

Mastodynia patients should be advised to eliminate caffeine beverages for a period of 2 to 3 months to determine if there has been improvement in their symptoms. In addition to caffeine abstention, patients should be urged to stop smoking because nicotine is purported to worsen mastodynia. A number of medications have been advocated for the treatment of mastodynia. Unfortunately, because of the subjective nature of the disease and its propensity to be better tolerated by patients with reassurance, the exact method of most of these interventions is unclear. Vitamin E has been touted as beneficial, however, clinical data do not support the use of this or other vitamins for this condition. The use of hormonal agents to treat mastodynia has been more extensively treated. Danazol, a weak antigen, is the most effective drug available for treatment of mastodynia related to fibrocystic disease. Unfortunately, Danazol’s androgenic side effects are troublesome enough to restrict its use to the most problematic cases of mastodynia. Other hormonal agents have been investigated for the management of mastodynia. In young women, oral contraceptives have a variable effect on mastodynia. A trial and error search for optimal preparations may be necessary as the effect of oral contraceptives is dependent on the formulation of the pill.",

Otherwise, timing of breast reconstruction is of no oncologic significance. Because most local recurrences occur in the skin’s subcutaneous tissues, the presence of a reconstruction will not interfere with detection. Similarly, a reconstruction does not complicate the administration of chemotherapy. Breast reconstruction techniques utilize either autogenous tissue or synthetic prostheses to recreate a breast mound. Prosthetic reconstruction is usually accomplished by sub-pectoral placement of a saline-or silicone gel-filled implant. Maintenance of an effective sub-pectoral pocket for an implant requires preservation of the pectoralis fascia and the medial pectoral nerve during mastectomy. The transferase rectus abdominous myocutaneous (TRAM) flap is the autogenous reconstruction of choice. The TRAM operation is complex and time consuming.

Invasive ductal carcinoma accounts for 70% to 80% of all cases of breast cancer. Although there is no single microscopic feature specific for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, it can be recognized histologically as an invasive adenocarcinoma involving ductal elements. The malignant ductal cells are often dispersed within the fibrous stroma, leading to the appellation of scirrhous carcinoma. A number of less common types of breast cancer arise from the ductal epithelium and are hence classified as variants of invasive ductal carcinoma. There are distinct histologic criteria for classifying these lesions; these criteria must be met throughout the entire tumor. Prognostically, histologically pure examples of these variant tumors are associated with a better long-term survival than ordinary type invasive ductal carcinoma. When mixed histologies are encountered, the clinical behavior parallels that of the invasive ductal element, not the other sub-type. Hence, these mixed tumors are considered together with pure invasive ductal carcinoma for prognostic purposes. In many cases, when areas of in situ ductal carcinoma are seen, the presence of an in situ component does not adversely affect prognosis, although it jeopardizes the attempts at breast conservation. Medullary carcinoma is one of the more common variants, accounting for approximately 6% of all invasive breast cancers. These tumors may grow to be a rather large size within the breast (5 to 10 cm) and are characteristically well-circumscribed. Mucinous carcinoma, also referred as colloid carcinoma, is encountered in 1% to 2% of breast cancer cases. Invasive lobular carcinoma arises from the lobular component of the breast and in most series accounts for approximately 10% of breast cancers. Almost every series has stressed the higher incidence of bilateral cancer in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma. The contralateral breast is involved either synchronously (3% of patients) or metachronously in up to 30% of patients.",

        "explanation": "Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a tumor arising in the mesenchymal tissue of the breast. The tumors usually present as a painless breast mass. Phyllodes tumor is most commonly encountered in women age 30–40 years of age but can occur at any age, even before puberty. The differentiation of a benign from a malignant phyllodes tumor may be difficult. About one-fourth of all phyllodes tumors are histologically malignant, but only a fraction of these patients actually develop metastatic disease. The optimum treatment for benign or malignant phyllodes tumor is wide excision with a margin of normal breast tissue. The margin must be histologically free of involvement because even benign lesions can recur after incomplete excision. If this can be done leaving an adequate cosmetic appearance, mastectomy is not necessary. Total mastectomy is reserved for large lesions in small-breasted women or recurrences after previous local excision that is not amenable to repeat local excision. Axillary lymph node dissection is not performed in the absence of biopsy-proven nodal involvement, even for malignant phyllodes tumors, because axillary metastases are uncommon.",

        "explanation": "Recurrence in the chest wall after mastectomy is ominous. In a large series of patients treated with mastectomy, 6.5% of node-negative and 8.8% of node-positive women had chest wall recurrence as their initial site of failure. By ten years after local-regional recurrence, about 60% of initially node-negative and almost all (> 90%) of initially node-positive patients had evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with local recurrence, who have not had prior chest wall radiation, should receive radiation therapy. A full course of at least 4500 to 5000 cGy should be delivered to the entire chest wall, with consideration given to a boost dose at any sites of gross tumor. Because post-mastectomy recurrence is often rapidly followed by metastatic disease, it is logical to postulate a role for adjuvant systemic therapy once local measures have achieved control of chest wall disease. Recent data suggests that in-breast recurrence following breast conservation is a prognostic factor. Women who develop an in-breast recurrence have a higher likelihood of developing systemic disease than do women who remain disease-free in their breast. Fewer than 3% of patients develop recurrence of disease in the axilla after axillary node dissection.",

Because of similar results and, because tamoxifen is generally less toxic than chemotherapy, this treatment is the treatment of choice for post-menopausal, node-positive, ER-positive women. CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) is associated with both a longer disease-free survival and overall survival time in pre-menopausal patients with positive lymph nodes. In post-menopausal women with positive nodes, there is an improved disease-free survival, but there is no significant difference in overall survival. Several trials of adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF or related regimens have been conducted in node-negative patients. The early results of all of these trials have been similar: disease-free survival is definitely improved with adjuvant chemotherapy. These studies are definitely not mature enough to draw definitive conclusions regarding overall survival. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute has recommended the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients with tumors large enough to have hormonal receptor levels measured.",

        "explanation": "Whatever tissue sampling method is chosen, only biopsy (examination of cells or tissue) and not physical examination or mammography can establish a definitive diagnosis and avoid delay in treatment. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) permits rapid, minimally invasive diagnosis of many palpable and some non-palpable, radiologically detected breast masses. The technique is both reliable and accurate. The incidence of false-positive findings is generally less than 0.5%. FNAB is not, however, so highly specific that definitive surgery (particularly mastectomy) should be performed without prior intraoperative frozen-section confirmation of the presence of cancer. Reported sensitivity of FNAB ranges from 7% to 99%; with 85% a good estimate of the true sensitivity in clinically relevant settings. Recently, x-ray-guided FNAB has been used to offer minimally invasive diagnosis in nonpalpable breast lesions detected mammographically. The technique is quite effective, especially for mass lesions. Accuracy is comparable to that achieved with FNAB of palpable lesions. Core-needle biopsy is a helpful tissue sampling method for palpable masses. The tissue obtained is useful for histologic analysis although inadequate for cytosol hormone receptor determination. The technique is also applicable by using mammographic guidance for nonpalpable lesions.",

Most commonly, it is detected on routine mammography as cluster microcalcifications without an associated palpable mass. In these cases, needle localization and excision are required to establish a diagnosis. Sclerosing adenosis microscopically is characterized by interlobular fibrosis and proliferation of small ductules. If the fibrous component is particularly intense, the orientation of lobules and epithelial cells may be lost, mimicking carcinoma.

In the first of these protocols, total mastectomy with delayed node dissection only for nodes that subsequently turned positive, total mastectomy with local-regional radiation therapy, and radical mastectomy were clinically equivalent. Furthermore, the finding that delay of axillary node dissection until there is clinical evidence of disease does not influence survival emphasizes that the role of axillary dissection in clinically node negative patients is solely for staging. The removal of clinically negative nodes has no therapeutic benefit if regional recurrences are detected and treated promptly. In the second of these protocols, modified radical mastectomy, lumpectomy with axillary node dissection, and lumpectomy, axillary node dissection, and breast or irradiation were compared in small breast cancers. Modified radical mastectomy offered no advantage over other treatments when analyzed by disease-free or overall survival in either node-negative or node-positive patients. Breast irradiation after lumpectomy reduced the likelihood of in-breast tumor recurrence from 39% to 10% but did not affect overall survival when compared with lumpectomy alone.",

          "A",
          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "Non-invasive (in situ) cancer is defined as a neoplastic entity within the epithelium of origin and without invasion to the basement membrane. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) arises from the ductular elements. The age distribution of DCIS does not differ significantly from that of invasive ductal carcinoma. Not every woman who undergoes complete excision of a focus DCIS develops invasive ductal cancer. Various studies suggest half or more patients develop invasive breast cancer after excisional biopsy alone. When a subsequent invasive cancer does occur, it is almost always of the invasive ductal type and located in the same quadrant of the breast as the initial DCIS. The latent period before the development of invasive cancer usually exceeds five years. Total mastectomy is usually associated with a nearly 100% cure rate for this condition. Although total mastectomy remains the gold-standard for treatment of DCIS, there is increasing experience with breast-conserving therapy. Breast conservation may be offered to DCIS patients in whom the entire tumor can be surgically removed with negative histologic margins and in whom the remaining breast tissue can be reliably assessed clinically and radiographically. It would appear that the disease-free survival following lumpectomy and radiation therapy is worse than that achievable with simple mastectomy. Therefore, breast conservation for DCIS commits patients to more careful long-term follow-up and will likely subject them to additional subsequent treatment to deal with the recurrences. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) accounts for one-third of the non-invasive breast cancers. LCIS patients are significantly younger than patients with invasive breast cancer. Three-fourths of affected women are pre-menopausal. LCIS is an infrequent finding in women over 75. When the opposite breast is sampled at the time of diagnosis, contralateral LCIS is found in 30–50% of cases. The prognosis of LCIS is solely related to the subsequent development of invasive carcinoma. About one-third of patients with biopsy-demonstrated LCIS develop invasive cancer; half occur in the index breast and half in the contralateral breast. The subsequent breast cancers can be either lobular or ductal in histology.",

Milk may continue to be secreted intermittently for as long as two years after breast feeding has stopped, particularly with breast stimulation. A milky whitish discharge, usually bilateral, that is not related to lactation or breast stimulation is termed “galactorrhea.” The presence of bilateral galactorrhea should prompt an evaluation for underlying endocrinopathy causing increased prolactin secretion by the pituitary. Classically, this is associated with amenorrhea, but galactorrhea may be the only sign of hypoprolactinemia. Nipple discharges associated with fibrocystic disease are generally, green, yellow, or brown, Intraductal papillomas and cancer lead to a bloody or blood-tinged serous discharge. The brownish discharge of fibrocystic disease can easily be confused with old blood. A guaiac test or simply dabbing the discharge with a gauze pad and examining the stain can usually differentiate the two. A bloody or blood-tinged discharge must be promptly evaluated to exclude carcinoma. If the discharge is expressible at the time the patient is seen, a contrast ductogram may be obtained.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The subxyphoid incision is useful for determining if there is blood in the pericardium and if there is an intracardiac injury; however, exposure is extremely limited, and definitive repair can rarely be performed through the incision. Left (or right) anterior thoracotomy is easily performed, especially in the emergency room, and gives adequate exposure to certain areas of the heart. However, each has significant limitations in exposure. Either may be extended across the thoracotomy into the other side of the chest, thus producing a bilateral anterior thoracotomy. Exposure is excellent through this incision, and most injuries can be satisfactorily repaired through this approach. Most cardiac operations today are performed through median sternotomy incisions. If the patient is in the operating room, this incision is easily performed and always provides excellent exposure for all areas of the heart.",

For an atrial level shunt, the compliance of the right and left ventricles and their ability to distend with increased volume during diastolic filling dictates the direction of the shunt flow. Since the right ventricle is usually a more compliant—and therefore more distensible—chamber than the left ventricle, flow across an ASD occurs from left to right across the open tricuspid valve during diastole. The size of an ASD does not correspond to the degree of shunt as long as the defect is large enough to be unrestrictive to flow.

The annulus of the tricuspid and aortic valves often form a part of the rim of the defect, but in some patients they are separated from the VSD by a thin rim of muscle tissue that protects the conduction bundle. Muscular VSDs have exclusively muscular rims on all four sides. VSDs in the outlet septum that extend to the annuluses of the aortic and pulmonary valves are called doubly committed or juxta-arterial defects. Isolated VSDs occur at an approximate rate of 2 per 1000 live births and represent 30% to 40% of all congenital heart malformations at birth. The conduction bundle in patients with perimembranous VSDs does run along the posteroinferior rim of the defect on the left ventricular side.

In the absence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure will also be systemic in the presence of a large VSD. Large VSDs associated with a high pulmonary blood flow do result in an enlarged left atrium because of increased pulmonary venous return. When marked enlargement of the left atrium is present in a patient suspected of having a VSD, the presence of coexisting mitral valve regurgitation should also be considered. Patients with small VSDs do have normal right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures. There is only a slight elevation of pulmonary blood flow relative to the systemic flow, and the pulmonary vascular resistance is normal without evidence of pulmonary vascular disease. At any age, the presence of pulmonary vascular disease so severe that the pulmonary vascular resistance is fixed and greater than 10 to 12 units per sq. m. is considered a contraindication to operation.",

Tachypnea, poor feeding, growth failure, recurrent respiratory infections, exercise intolerance, and severe cardiac failure may develop in patients with large VSDs. Patients with Eisenmenger's complex are cyanotic, polycythemic, and severely limited in their exercise tolerance, owing to markedly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance associated with a predominantly right-to-left shunt across the VSD.

Patients with tetralogy of Fallot rarely have excessive pulmonary blood flow, and the development of pulmonary hypertension is not a concern in this population. Banding of the pulmonary artery is never a consideration in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, since the predominant physiologic effect of the defect results from too little pulmonary blood flow to begin with. Acyanotic patients with tetralogy of Fallot (“pink tets”) can usually be followed for several months and their defects repaired electively as a first-stage procedure (usually by age 6 months). All of the other therapies are appropriate treatment for babies with tetralogy of Fallot. Prostaglandins maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus, providing an anatomic systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt that sustains pulmonary blood flow until a more permanent surgical solution can be provided. The advent of prostaglandin therapy has enabled numerous critically ill infants to become stabilized enough to reach a tertiary care institution and receive proper surgical therapy who might not otherwise have survived had it not been for the ability of pulmonary blood flow to be maintained through the reversal of duct closing. The choice of palliative shunting or total anatomic correction rests largely with the experience and skill of the surgical team and is dictated in part by the anatomy of the pulmonary arteries.

In the Taussig-Bing type of double-outlet right ventricle, the VSD is related to the pulmonary valve annulus and is termed a subpulmonary defect. Additional morphologic characteristics peculiar to this entity have been described. Most patients with double-outlet right ventricle and a subaortic VSD have concomitant pulmonary stenosis that protects the lungs from pulmonary vascular disease and also results in a clinical course similar to that of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. In the absence of pulmonary stenosis the presentation, clinical course, and natural history of the Taussig-Bing malformation are similar to those of transposition of the great arteries with VSD. Cyanosis is present, usually from birth, since streaming directs the desaturated systemic venous return toward the aorta and the oxygenated left ventricular blood toward the pulmonary artery.

The Taussig-Bing malformation can be repaired using an intraventricular tunnel technique described by Kawashima. This repair can best be accomplished when the great arteries are in a more or less side-by-side relationship with the aorta to the right of the pulmonary artery. The infundibular septum is generously resected and the VSD is connected to the aorta by an intraventricular tunnel that runs posterior to the pulmonary artery. The most common approach for the repair of the Taussig-Bing malformation involves patch closure of the VSD to the pulmonary artery. This creates transposition of the great arteries with an intact interventricular septum. An arterial switch procedure then establishes ventriculoarterial concordance. Of all the types of double-outlet right ventricle the hospital mortality is lowest when a subaortic or doubly committed VSD is present. Double-outlet right ventricle is associated with a noncommitted VSD in approximately 10% of patients in surgical series. The repair of this subset of patients is associated with a relatively high mortality, as compared with the results obtained after repair of other forms of double-outlet right ventricle. At times, because of the remote location of the VSD and because of other compelling anatomic features, complete repair cannot be performed.

Pulmonary vascular resistance in excess of 4 Woods units should also be considered an absolute contraindication for Fontan correction. Age at the time of Fontan procedure does not appear to be a major risk factor, except before age 2 years. Although patients who have survived into the third or fourth decade are likely to have ventricular dysfunction, a Fontan procedure can be performed successfully in these older patients if ventricular function and pulmonary vascular resistance meet the above criteria. In patients with tricuspid atresia a competent mitral valve is important for satisfactory cardiac output after the Fontan procedure. The presence of severe mitral insufficiency, however, should not necessarily contraindicate the procedure. In these cases it is recommended that the mitral valve be repaired or replaced in combination with the creation of a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis.

Although the aortic saturation can never be 100% because of some element of bidirectional shunting at the VSD, the physiologic manifestations are congestive heart failure and excessive pulmonary blood flow rather than cyanosis. The congestive heart failure becomes severe as pulmonary vascular resistance drops. If congestive heart failure later improves spontaneously, it is because of the development of pulmonary vascular disease. Complete repair always requires closure of the VSD, detachment of the pulmonary arteries from the common trunk, and re-establishment of an outflow tract from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. This conduit usually contains a valve and can be either a homograft or a synthetic conduit containing a porcine valve.",

The pulmonary arteries arise abnormally from the single trunk, which is due to failed partitioning of the embryonic conus during the first few weeks of fetal development.

Subaortic stenosis cannot occur in this anomaly. The single ventricular outflow valve is the truncal valve. It may contain from two to six cusps, but most often there are three and, next most often, four.",

Initially infants with transposition and intact atrial septum survive because of aortopulmonary flow through PDA, which may be maintained with prostaglandin infusions. Although increased pulmonary flow may cause enlargement of the left atrium and stretching of the foramen ovale resulting in atrial-level mixing of oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood, inadequate mixing at the atrial level will result in marginal tissue oxygenation, which does not improve with oxygen administration. Atrial balloon septotomy results in improved admixture and oxygen delivery in these patients and should be performed promptly if peripheral acidemia and severe cyanosis are present. Relative dehydration may decrease the degree of interatrial shunting and volume infusion often improves hemodynamics in infants. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance may increase pulmonary blood flow at the expense of systemic blood flow and alter the loading conditions of the left ventricle, which may complicate early arterial repair.",

Contraindications to arterial switch repair include fixed types of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, including valvar pulmonic stenosis, which would render the systemic semilunar valve stenotic or incompetent. Anatomic abnormalities without stenosis, such as a bicuspid valve, however, are suitable for surgical correction. The location of VSD does not affect surgical outcome, and most VSDs can be approached adequately through the right atrium or the anterior great vessel. Most dynamic forms of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction are often relieved partially or completely by realignment of the ventricular septum with the hemodynamic changes following successful arterial switch repair. When, however, the left ventricle has not been prepared to sustain the pressure load of the systemic circulation by the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance that occurs in the first few weeks of life and when the ventricular pressure is less than 50% of the systemic ventricular pressure, one-stage repair is contraindicated, and staged repair with pulmonary banding and shunt followed by arterial switch must be contemplated.",

This results in an anatomic right ventricle with abnormal geometry sustaining the afterload of a more ideally suited left ventricle. Long-term complications of ventricular dilatation, AV valve regurgitation, and right ventricular failure have been reported in as many as 10% of patients many years following the atrial operation. The multiple suture lines in the atrium have been associated with a high incidence of late atrial arrhythmias and a low incidence of sinus rhythm following the Mustard and Senning operations. These complications do not appear to be as frequent with the arterial switch repair. In addition, the complicated interatrial baffles have been associated with pulmonary or systemic venous baffle obstruction. Because the right ventricular outflow tract is not addressed during an atrial switch operation, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is not a recognized complication following the repair. Right ventricular outflow tract and supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, however, have been reported in patients after the arterial switch repair, owing to the reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract in that operation. Although progression of pulmonary arterial obstruction has rarely been reported following early repair with the atrial or the arterial switch procedure, it is an unusual complication if operation is undertaken in infancy. Delayed repair beyond age 6 months to 1 year, however, has been associated with a higher incidence of progressive development of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease. The rapidity of the development of pulmonary vascular disease is increased by the coexistence of a VSD.",

Aortic valve replacement is rarely necessary as a primary procedure but may be required in children who develop progressive aortic insufficiency after a previous intervention. When valve replacement is performed it is desirable to insert the largest prosthesis possible, to allow for growth. Enlargement of the aortic annulus is commonly performed for this purpose. If a true valve prosthesis is employed, a mechanical valve is preferred. Durability of xenograft valves in children is limited owing to early calcification and leaflet degeneration. The pulmonary autograft technique may be the best method of aortic valve replacement in children. With this operation the patient's own pulmonary valve is transferred to the aortic position and a pulmonary allograft is inserted to replace the pulmonary valve. Although the pulmonary autograft may not achieve the long-term durability of a mechanical valve, the patient does not face the long-term complications of thromboembolism and bleeding imposed by a mechanical valve and lifelong anticoagulation.",

Patients with an intact IMA graft are less likely to require reoperation, but if stenosis distal to the IMA and disease in other vein grafts have progressed or if a large portion of myocardium is at risk, reoperation is recommended. The presence of an intact IMA is not a contraindication to reoperation; in fact, this population of patients have better-preserved ventricular function and are, perhaps, better candidates for reoperation. Placement of an IMA graft at the time of the first operation was critically important, neutralizing the adverse effects of elevated serum cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking on reoperation-free survival. The risk of damaging an intact IMA graft is 3% to 5%. A lateral projection of the IMA at cardiac catheterization will define its course, particularly in relation to the sternum, to allow more careful sternal re-entry. The IMA should be minimally dissected and a light clamp applied during cardioplegic arrest to limit cardiac warming and improve myocardial protection. The IMA may be detached and recycled if needed.

In contrast to primary CABG, where the majority of deaths are a result of failure of other organ systems, 75% to 85% of deaths after reoperative CABG are due to cardiac causes. The increased risk of reoperation results from more advanced native vessel disease, a longer cross-clamp time, a longer cross-clamp time per graft, a longer time to initiate cardiopulmonary bypass, and increased blood loss. The increased frequency of pulmonary complications, myocardial infarction, neurologic injury, and death, stems from the technical factors of reoperation and the characteristics of the patient population. Technical factors include difficulty in finding targets secondary to pericardial reaction and more diffusely diseased vessels, the risks of injuring the heart or great vessels on sternal re-entry, increased blood loss and risk of requiring transfusion, less available conduit for bypass, and greater difficulty in providing optimal myocardial protection. Characteristics of this patient population that increase risks include advanced age and diminished ventricular function. While survival after reoperation is nearly equivalent to that after primary CABG, angina symptoms return at twice the frequency in the first year after operation (47% versus 20%) then return at a similar annual rate (2% to 3%).",

The goal of initial therapy of Kawasaki's disease is the reduction of inflammation, including coronary and myocardial inflammation. After the diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease is secured, patients are treated with intravenous gamma globulin and large doses of aspirin. Gamma globulin, 2 gm. per kg., is administered as a single infusion over 12 hours. Treatment with intravenous immune globulin has been shown to decrease the duration of fever, to decrease the prevalence of cardiovascular complications, and to prevent the progression to giant coronary aneurysms. High-dose aspirin therapy contributes to the resolution of the acute manifestations of Kawasaki's disease. When Kawasaki's disease is diagnosed, children are given a regimen of aspirin, 100 mg. per kg. per day, which is continued until defervescence. Thereafter, they are maintained on small doses of aspirin, 3 to 5 mg. per kg. per day, for 8 weeks. The goal of aspirin therapy is amelioration of symptoms and prevention of the thrombotic and embolic complications of Kawasaki's disease.

The tricuspid regurgitation and functional right ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by the large anterior leaflet lead to right-to-left shunting across the ASD. Systemic venous hypertension is often present, but pulmonary hypertension almost never occurs with this malformation.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The surgical procedure most commonly employed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation is catheter ablation of the His bundle. The International Catheter Ablation Registry reveals that more than 60% of patients who undergo elective catheter ablation of the bundle of His do so for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. His bundle ablation is an isolation procedure, in that it confines the atrial fibrillation to the atria and protects the ventricles from the unpleasant sensation of an irregular heartbeat. Because the atria continue to fibrillate there is no restoration of AV synchrony, and therefore there is no improvement in cardiac hemodynamics. Moreover, the continuing fibrillation of the left atrium means that postoperatively the patient is still at the same risk for thromboembolism. Thus, His bundle ablation corrects only one of the three detrimental sequelae of atrial fibrillation, namely the arrhythmia problem. The left atrial isolation procedure confines atrial fibrillation to the left atrium, allowing the sinus node to drive the remainder of the heart in a normal sinus rhythm. Thus, it alleviates the unpleasant sensation of an irregular heartbeat. In addition, because AV synchrony is re-established between the right atrium and right ventricle, right-sided cardiac output is restored to normal. This means that normal cardiac output is delivered through the lungs to the left side of the heart. In the presence of a normal left ventricle the left-sided cardiac output is also normal, despite the fact that left-sided AV synchrony is not present; however, because the left atrium is allowed to fibrillate, the vulnerability to thromboembolism remains unchanged postoperatively. The corridor procedure allows the sinus node to drive the heart in normal sinus rhythm, but because of the total isolation of the sinoatrial and AV nodes from the remainder of the atria, the atria may continue to fibrillate. Even if they do not, in effect they are isolated from their respective ventricles so that AV synchrony is lost on both sides of the heart. As a result, the corridor procedure alleviates the sensation of arrhythmia but does not restore normal hemodynamics, nor does it decrease vulnerability to thromboembolism. The maze procedure ablates the re-entrant circuits responsible for atrial fibrillation and restores the normal sinus rhythm. Thus, it alleviates the sensation of arrhythmia, restores normal hemodynamics, and alleviates the vulnerability to thromboembolism. 83. All of the following statements about nonischemic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are true except: DISCUSSION: Nonischemic ventricular tachyarrhythmias usually occur in the right ventricle, and as a result the ECG shows a left bundle branch block–type pattern during ventricular tachycardia.

Owing to an autoimmune phenomenon, left atrial myxomas can present with systemic constitutional symptoms of fever, malaise, weight loss, polymyositis, and blood dyscrasias that mimic collagen vascular disease. Of surgical significance is the fact that most myxomas rarely extend deeper than the endocardium but grow as polypoid, intracavitary masses.

Although wall tension does increase with increased volume, Starling properties are called forth for added efficiency. Preload is controlled by volume status as well as capacity of the venous system. The effects of balloon counterpulsation on cardiac preload are minimal and secondary to other changes. As the balloon collapses in the aorta, the absence of the balloon volume, or “abyss,” creates a decrease in ventricular afterload. In effect this decreases ventricular wall tension, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption significantly. During counterpulsation, the intra-aortic balloon inflates in diastole, elevating coronary perfusion pressure significantly. Maximal coronary artery perfusion occurs in this part of the cardiac cycle. Thus, ischemic ventricles benefit especially from balloon pumping. The balloon pump does not directly decrease the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. However, in ventricles failing from ischemia the combination of afterload reduction and improved coronary blood flow usually augments cardiac function, producing decreased cardiac filling pressure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Medically refractory angina is one of the major indications for implementing the intra-aortic balloon pump. When intravenous nitroglycerin becomes ineffective at relieving chest pain or results in early hypotension, the balloon pump should be used in preparation for surgical revascularization or percutaneous angioplasty. By reducing left ventricular afterload, the pump reduces regurgitation into the left atrium. Thus, balloon counterpulsation is very helpful for treating patients with acute mitral insufficiency secondary to papillary muscle rupture. Patients should undergo valve surgical procedures emergently, as balloon pump support is only temporizing. The mere presence of a left main coronary lesion is not an indication for use of the balloon pump. In former years such pumps were inserted prophylactically before induction of anesthesia for coronary bypass surgery. Newer anesthetic techniques have largely obviated this; however, in the presence of a left main lesion and medically refractory angina the balloon pump should be used. The balloon pump is quite effective in helping to wean patients who have postcardiotomy left ventricular failure from cardiopulmonary bypass. This is one of the major uses of this device. The Emory University group was the first to expound on the efficacy of the balloon pump in stabilizing patients following percutaneous angioplasty failure. With the pump inserted, most patients can be transported to the operating room safely, many being stable enough to harvest an internal mammary graft instead of having to defer to the more accessible but less preferable saphenous vein.",

The balloon must be positioned well below the aortic arch vessels and never proximal to the left subclavian artery origin. Strokes have been reported from emboli being thrown retrograde from the balloon; however, this is very rare. Limb ischemia is one of the most frequent complications of balloon pumping. The combination of iliofemoral atherosclerosis and catheter luminal obstruction may impede distal flow. This may require catheter removal to re-establish flow. In 2% to 10% of patients, arterial reconstruction is necessary to repair balloon-related complications. Smaller catheters have helped prevent limb ischemia. Arrhythmias in general are not complications of balloon pumping. In fact, arrhythmias related to ischemia may be controlled by the balloon pump. Aortic thrombosis can occur very rarely with pump use. A more frequent occurrence is distal embolization with limb ischemia. Patients should be heparinized while the balloon catheter is in place. Following cardiac surgery heparinization is usually delayed for 12 to 24 hours.",

It is usually classified according to the morphology of the anterior leaflet of the AV valve. The pulmonary vascular resistance remains elevated in infancy delaying diagnosis and producing fixed splitting of the second heart sound. Cardiac catheterization is indicated to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, but pulmonary artery banding is no longer performed to protect the pulmonary bed. Instead, operative repair is made, preferably before the age of 6 months.",

ACTH may be released during stress in response to interleukin-1, -2, and -6. Somatotrophic actions of GH are indirect and are mediated by the insulinlike growth factors formerly known as somatomedins. Current classification of anterior pituitary cells is based on immunochemical identification of their secretory products (i.e., corticotropes produce ACTH, lactotropes produce prolactin, and thyrotropes produce thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]).",

Some 10% to 20% of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is caused by ectopic production of ACTH from small cell carcinoma of the lung, carcinoid tumors, tumors of the endocrine pancreas, pheochromocytoma, and MTC. ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome secondary to primary adrenal pathology occurs in 10% to 20% of cases in adults and is the most common form in children. Measurement of cortisol in two to three consecutive 24-hour collections of urine is the best screening test for Cushing's syndrome: plasma levels of cortisol show marked variability, and a single random level is not helpful in establishing the diagnosis. ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome suppresses the pituitary and is diagnosed if the basal serum ACTH level is suppressed below 5 pg. per ml., if the hypercortisolism is not suppressed by high-dose dexamethasone, or if the metyrapone stimulation test is negative. The dexamethasone suppression and metyrapone tests do not, however, distinguish an adrenal from an ectopic ACTH cause of Cushing's since both suppress the pituitary.

Various factors may cause changes in the concentration of TBG. Contraceptive pills and pregnancy increase the amount of TBG, while anticonvulsive medications and chronic debilitating disease may decrease the amount of TBG. Administration of excess amounts of iodine may lower the rate of active iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. The thyroid suppression test is based on the principle that administration of thyroid hormone does not suppress the patient's thyroid function when normal homeostatic mechanisms are disrupted. Thyroid function is nonsuppressible in hyperthyroidism or in the presence of thyroid hormone–secreting tumors. Serum cholesterol, deep tendon reflex time, and cardiovascular functions can be measured to reflect hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism but do not give an indication of the etiology of hypothyroidism.",

Because of the high failure rate of long-term treatment with thionamides, the use of these drugs as definitive treatment has decreased. Drawbacks include the important 0.5% incidence of agranulocytosis and a recurrence rate as high as 43% during the first year when the drug is stopped. Five years after treatment only 25% of patients remain in remission. Unlike other definitive treatments, hypothyroidism does not occur as a result of thionamide treatment if an appropriate dosage is used. 131I has been used as definitive treatment for patients with Graves’ disease for many years with predictable and long-lasting good results in most patients. It has few, if any, serious side effects. It is ablative to the thyroid gland and hypothyroidism is a nearly inevitable result of effective therapy, although it may take years to become clinically apparent. About 70% of patients treated with 131I are hypothyroid within 10 years of treatment. The risk of recurrence of hyperthyroidism after an initial response is less than 5%. Most adult patients in the United States are treated with 131I as definitive treatment for Graves’ disease. Exceptions are women in the childbearing years where a subsequent fetus would be affected, patients with concomitant thyroid nodules where carcinoma is a concern, those with extremely large glands and, increasingly, those who are opposed to 131I therapy. Thyroidectomy is an important alternative in selected patients with Graves’ disease. Although controversial in the past, it now appears that ocular involvement does not respond more favorably to thyroidectomy than to 131I ablation.",

        "explanation": "The thyroid gland is a vascular organ supplied by four main arteries: two superior and two inferior. The superior thyroid artery usually arises as the first branch of the external carotid artery just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. The superior thyroid artery descends medially on the surface of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle to divide into an anterior and posterior branch at the apex of the thyroid lobe on its anteromedial surface. Its relation to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is important during thyroid lobectomy. The inferior thyroid arteries usually arise from the thyrocervical trunks and ascend behind the carotid sheath before passing downward and medial to enter the thyroid gland at its middle portion. There are no arteries directly entering the lower poles from below with the exception of a thryoidea ima artery that may replace an absent inferior artery. Thyroidea ima arteries arise from either the innominate artery or aorta in 1% to 4% of individuals, entering the lower surface of the isthmus after coursing on the trachea. The pretracheal fascia is referred to as the thyroid sheath and it varies in consistency and completeness among individuals. Posteromedially, it is usually condensed and firmly attaches the thyroid gland to the upper two or three tracheal rings and the cricoid cartilage. The superior parathyroid gland may lie between the sheath and the thyroid capsule, within the sheath, posterior to it in a potentially open plane, or occasionally anterior to the sheath. The inferior parathyroid gland likewise may be within the sheath, particularly when the gland is adherent to the lower pole of the thyroid.",

About 20% of all papillary carcinomas do not trap sufficient iodine for imaging or therapy. These are usually patients with papillary carcinoma variants: a tall cell variant of papillary carcinoma, insular carcinoma, or clear cell carcinoma. Nearly all metastatic follicular carcinomas retain the ability to trap 131I sufficiently for imaging and for therapy. Even well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinoma cannot compete successfully for 131I with normal thyroid tissue and unless this has been removed or subsequently ablated with an initial dose of 131I, many metastases cannot be detected or treated.",

        "explanation": "There are three types of thyroiditis that can cause thyroid abnormalities of surgical significance. The most common is chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that can occur in any age group. Occasionally, Hashimoto disease causes unilateral thyroid enlargement that simulates malignancy. The rarest form of thyroiditis is Riedel struma which can mimic a diffuse thyroid carcinoma because of the fibrotic infiltrative process that results. Hashimoto thyroiditis is associated with reduced functional capacity of the thyroid which increases TSH secretion, and a goiter develops. Because of the associated fibrosis, a nodular goiter or neoplasm is suggested. Thyroidectomy may be indicated for treatment of a solitary nodule, particularly if it is cold, suspicious, definitely malignant or solid, and fine needle aspirate is indeterminate. Granulomatous, DeQuervain, and subacute thyroiditis are terms that refer to a disease that usually occurs in young women within weeks of an upper respiratory or other viral infection. The disease is usually self-limited, but may persist for several months longer. In unusual patients, the disease may be confined to one lobe and result in a firm, slightly tender mass suggesting carcinoma. Lobectomy may be indicated to rule out the presence of malignancy. Total thyroidectomy may be considered for persistent, painful thyroiditis after months of steroid therapy have failed. Goiter with a woody or fibrous component involving the adjacent strap muscles and carotid sheaths is referred to as Riedel struma. It is rare and the cause is not known. It is associated with other types of fibrotic processes including retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and fibrosing mediastinitis. Although considered self-limited, the process may be associated with considerable morbidity as a result of localized pain and compression of adjacent structures such as the airway. Occasionally, tracheostomy is required. Airway compression may also require open biopsy resection of the isthmus with as much as the fibrosis as possible without endangering the recurrent laryngeal nerves.",

It is preferable to divide only the branch of the inferior thyroid artery medial to those that supply either of the parathyroid glands. This requires individual clamping of smaller vessels under the thyroid sheath as these vessels penetrate into the thyroid capsule. Ligation of the main trunk of the inferior thyroid artery was commonly used for bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy in the past. It did not routinely cause hypoparathyroidism only because enough collateral blood supply was maintained to each end artery to one or more parathyroid glands. This is to be avoided.",

        "explanation": "Seventy to 80% of the 11,000 new patients with thyroid carcinoma diagnosed annually in the United States have papillary carcinoma. Papillary carcinomas of the thyroid include minimal thyroid carcinoma, intrathyroidal, and extrathyroidal (invasion through the true thyroid capsule) disease. Minimal thyroid carcinoma refers to those papillary carcinomas that are less than 1 cm in diameter and not associated with any clinically apparent lymph node metastases. In contrast to clinically significant papillary carcinomas, these are common and are found in 2% to 13% of adult thyroid glands serially sectioned after autopsy studies of individuals who have died from other causes. For tumors between 0.5 and 1 cm, a total lobectomy and isthmus resection are satisfactory treatment. Most clinically significant papillary carcinomas are 1 to 4 cm in diameter and are contained within the thyroid capsule. Multicentricity is relatively common and can be found on gross sectioning of the thyroid gland in 20% to 30% of cases. Furthermore, after serial sectioning of the entire thyroid gland in patients with papillary carcinoma, microscopic foci are found in 70% to 80%. Local cervical lymph node metastases are found in about 30% of all patients with papillary carcinoma. The presence of lymph node metastases does not correlate as closely to the size of the tumor as it does to the age of the patient. The younger the patient, the greater the likelihood of metastatic lymph node involvement. Nearly all patients under 15 years of age have involved metastatic lymph nodes. The presence or absence of lymph node metastases in patients with intrathyroidal primary papillary carcinomas does not appear to have an appreciable effect on long-term survival if distant metastases are not present at the time of initial treatment.",

For routine scanning, 131I scanning has been replaced by either 123I or 99mTc. Because of the lower radiation exposure, cost and easy use, 99mTc is preferentially used. The differential diagnosis of a solitary nonfunctioning nodule includes carcinoma, colloid nodule, nonfunctioning adenoma, and cyst. The prevalence of carcinoma ranges from 5% to 20% in cold nodules and such lesions require further evaluation. If the scan detects other nonfunctioning areas in addition to the palpable nodule, the gland is at low risk for carcinoma because most patients with this finding have a multinodular goiter. A solitary, discrete area of increased activity is more often found in a young patient with an otherwise normal thyroid gland. Multiple hot spots are typically found in an older patient with a multinodular goiter. A functioning solitary nodule that is independent of TSH is considered an autonomous nodule and can be the cause of hyperthyroidism. It is hot on scintigraphic scan. The presence of a cold nodule is insufficient information to determine a treatment plan. Although nearly all carcinomas are cold, most cold nodules are benign. Fine needle aspiration cytology is considered the most reliable means of evaluation for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules that are nonfunctional or hypofunctional by nuclide scan.",

Iodine was the first effective drug to be used in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis. It can block the organification and coupling steps in thyroid hormone synthesis as well as prevent the release of thyroid hormone. Furthermore, iodine in large doses probably inhibits the ability of TSH to stimulate cyclic AMP release at the follicular cell membrane. Commonly used antithyroid drugs are propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole (Tapazole) and carbimazole. Carbimazole is widely used in Great Britain, only PTU and methimazole are commonly used in the United States. PTU interferes with the incorporation of iodine into the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin, thus preventing oxidation of iodide to iodine. It also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Although both PTU and methimazole are thionamides, methimazole does not have this peripheral effect, making PTU the preferred drug for patients with thyroid storm. About 3% of patients taking PTU demonstrate at least one side effect during the first 3 months of therapy whereas the prevalence with methimazole is about 7%.

        "explanation": "Total extracapsular thyroid lobectomy and isthmus resection is the procedure of choice when a decision has been made to surgically remove a thyroid nodule. The entire lobe with the isthmus is submitted for frozen-section pathologic examination if fine needle aspirate has not already resulted in a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma. In performing total lobectomy, both parathyroid glands are carefully preserved with their blood supply. This is done in the event that total thyroidectomy is necessary if either the frozen or permanent histologic sections confirm the presence of thyroid carcinoma. Total lobectomy offers the best opportunity for accurate histologic diagnosis and is associated with the lowest incidence of complications when the need for reoperation is considered. In one experience, 800 consecutive cases of total unilateral lobectomy were performed for benign or malignant nodules suspected of cancer, and no permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies occurred. Primary total lobectomy is safer than a partial lobectomy followed by resection of the residual lobe after a delayed diagnosis of malignancy. Reoperation to complete a lobectomy is associated with a greater risk to both recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroids on the ipsilateral side. Although there is controversy as to whether a total lobectomy and isthmus resection or a total thyroidectomy is the best definitive operation for unilateral papillary carcinoma, a subtotal lobectomy is universally considered an inadequate operation. A definitive cancer operation can be accomplished with one procedure in 80% of the cases when a skilled thyroid pathologist is available for frozen-section interpretation.",

        "explanation": "When interpreted by a skilled cytologist, fine needle aspiration is highly accurate and is considered the preferred method of selecting patients with thyroid nodules for surgery. Nearly 80% of patients with thyroid nodules were spared surgical exploration as a result of such studies in one report. Because of the risk of false-negative diagnoses (10%), advocates of this technique emphasize the importance of clinical judgment in addition to the cytologic study in selecting operative candidates. In most cases, fine needle aspiration cytology enables the pathologist to distinguish nonneoplastic from neoplastic nodules and to identify the type of malignant tumor. Papillary, medullary, and anaplastic carcinoma all have a typical cytologic appearance. Cytologic studies cannot differentiate malignant from benign follicular or Hürthle cell neoplasms. In this case, a definitive diagnosis depends on histologic examination of the entire excised tumor. Fine needle aspiration has dramatically reduced the number of diagnostic surgical operations for benign lesions in centers where it is used extensively. In patients with thyroid nodules and a history of previous head and neck radiation, operation is generally recommended regardless of cytologic findings. In these patients, both benign and malignant lesions may develop and the chances of sampling error are considerable.",

It is familial in 20% to 30% of all cases and its secretion of a biologic marker (calcitonin) allows detection of its presence with the tumor is too small to palpate. MCT appears in three clinical settings. The first is a sporadic tumor, usually in patients 30 years or older. Second, MCT occurs as a component of the MEN IIa syndrome with or without adrenal medullary disease (pheochromocytoma) or hyperparathyroidism. A family history of thyroid carcinoma with or without pheochromocytoma is invariably present. MCT in the MEN IIa syndrome is always bilateral and multicentric and arises from C-cell hyperplasia. MCT usually does not develop before age 12 and is almost always clinically apparent before age 30. Lastly, MCT is found as a component of the MEN IIb syndrome without or without bilateral adrenal medullary disease and always with the facies and autonomic nervous system dysplasia expressed as ganglioneuromatosis from the lips to the anus. These patients often have a marfanoid habitus and skeletal deformities as well. The MEN IIb syndrome occurs as a sporadic mutation, but its familial occurrence is becoming more common because patients are surviving now long enough to reproduce. MCT or its precursor, C-cell hyperplasia, develops by age 2 in MEN IIb and is always bilateral and multicentric. As a result of its early appearance and late detection, the disease has usually been more advanced when treatment has been instituted. Minimal treatment of MCT is total thyroidectomy. The overall prognosis for 10-year survival is approximately 50%, although the tumor growth rate in individual patients has shown great variability. Patients with the MEN IIb disease require total thyroidectomy as soon as the syndrome is recognized, preferably by the age of 2 years. In familial cases, the characteristic findings are sufficient even without calcitonin testing to justify operation. If the diagnosis is not made until adolescence or later, both central compartment and lateral node involvement require neck dissection for definitive treatment.",

        "explanation": "The thyroid is the only endogenous source of T4, whereas most T3 is produced by the peripheral conversion of T4. This takes place in the liver, muscle, kidney and anterior pituitary. Under normal circumstances, only about 20% of T3 is secreted directly from the thyroid gland. In some thyroid diseases (e.g., Graves’ disease and toxic nodular goiter), the proportion of T3 secreted directly by the thyroid may be markedly increased. Once thyroid hormones are released into the circulation, they are bound to thyroid-binding globulin (85%), albumin (10%) and transthyretin (prealbumin). These binding proteins allow the thyroid hormones to remain soluble in plasma, contributing to systemic distribution to various target-cell populations. A limited amount of thyroid hormones circulates freely in the plasma in metabolically active form (free T4, free T3). At the cell membrane, an excess of thyroid hormone results in an increased number of ATP-dependent sodium pumps, thus increasing resting energy expenditure and oxygen consumption. Thyroid hormone also facilitates the transport of glucose and amino acids across the cell membrane. In addition, T3-induced mitochondrial oxidation of substrate results in increased ATP production.",

        "explanation": "Hyperthyroidism in the patient with a multinodular goiter usually develops in women after age 50 but is seen occasionally in younger patients. Most patients have had a nontoxic nodular goiter for many years. Preferred treatment for most patients with toxic multinodular goiters is thyroidectomy after adequate preparation renders the patient euthyroid. 131I may be an alternative in selected poor-risk patients with goiters that are not causing airway compression. Although 131I can be used to treat the hyperthyroidism, larger and often repeated doses of 131I may be required. 131I does not significantly reduce the goiter size and may, because of radiation-induced thyroiditis, cause acute enlargement. This may be hazardous in the patient with some degree of preexisting airway compression. Any airway symptoms, particularly in patients with substernal goiters, should be considered strong contraindications to the use of 131I. Standard surgical treatment of toxic nodular goiter has consisted of bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy. Remnant size is not as important as the excision of all autonomous nodules. Because thyroid replacement or suppression is used routinely to prevent recurrence of goiter when a subtotal resection is done, the risk of hypothyroidism is not a consideration in determining remnant size. Alternative procedures are total lobectomy with isthmus resection and contralateral subtotal lobectomy, or total thyroidectomy. The latter is not demonstrably superior and may have more technical complications.",

        "explanation": "Follicular carcinoma accounts for about 10% of all new carcinomas of the thyroid. Most patients are those with minimal invasion of the capsule or vessels within the neoplasms. Such tumors are seldom diagnosed definitively by either needle aspiration cytology or by frozen-section diagnosis at the time of lobectomy. Most frequently, the diagnosis is made after the study of permanent sections. Microinvasive encapsulated follicular carcinomas are rarely associated with metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastases involving bone are also rare at the time of diagnosis. Angioinvasive follicular carcinomas are usually large and frequently show venous invasion of perithyroidal and lateral neck veins at the time of diagnosis. They may have already metastasized to different sites, most frequently the bone. These tumors are often diagnosed at the time of operation because of these characteristics. Most patients younger than 40 do well, but patients older than 50 years have a guarded prognosis. Follicular carcinomas of the thyroid are treated by total thyroidectomy. Lymphatic dissections are not usually required because only about 5% of all patients have lymphatic involvement. The most effective therapy for bone or pulmonary metastases is radioactive iodine. The controversy in the surgical management of follicular carcinoma is whether patients with low-grade encapsulated neoplasms diagnosed after total lobectomy by permanent section evaluation should be treated with total thyroidectomy. In patients with smaller follicular neoplasms found malignant as determined by microinvasion of the capsule, completion thyroidectomy is usually not done; instead patients are observed closely after performing a 99mTc bone scan to rule out occult bone metastases. Patients with large or high-grade angioinvasive lesions require total thyroidectomy.",

In addition, surgery was agreed upon for those patients in whom medical surveillance was neither desirable nor suitable, such as when the patient requests surgery, consistent follow-up is unlikely, co-existent illness complicates management, or if the patient is young (< 50 year of age). In one recent study of a group of 142 asymptomatic patients followed without operation, after 10 years, more than 20% of the patients had required surgery for an increase in serum calcium to greater than 11 mg/dL or for specific complications attributable to the disease.

Tumors are virtually always bilateral and develop in multiple areas of the middle and upper portions of the thyroid lobe. Detection has historically been based on elaboration of calcitonin, particularly in response to provocative testing by the potent secretagogues calcium and pentagastrin. Patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid have striking increases in plasma calcitonin levels after provocative testing, which allows them to be readily identified. By employing provocative testing in kindred members at risk for disease, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was diagnosed at a preclinical stage, and a greater percentage of these patients were cured by surgical therapy. With genetic testing now available, early treatment of medullary thyroid cancer should be possible for all affected people, to hopefully enhance the number of people cured of this cancer.

These patients are often dehydrated before therapy, and fluid can be administered intravenously at a rate of 200 mL/h. Caution must be exercised in older patients who might have marginal cardiac reserve. The diuretic furosemide also increases excretion of sodium and calcium but should not be employed until the patient is well hydrated. Saline diuresis is usually effective when the hypercalcemia results from hyperparathyroidism or from a benign cause. In contrast, the hypercalcemia of malignancy may produce severe symptoms associated with extremely high serum calcium levels that are difficult to control. In this setting, a variety of other measures may be considered (see Table 57-3). Some of the agents used to treat hypercalcemia have significant toxicity and require close monitoring. Calcitonin is a fairly weak hypocalcemic agent, but it acts rapidly and is relatively less toxic. Glucocorticoids may be particularly efficacious in patients with sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases. Mithramycin has proved useful in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, but it has a substantial cumulative toxicity (thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity).

Most patients undergoing operation on the thyroid experience some alteration in serum calcium. The hypocalcemia is usually transient and is not treated unless significant symptoms develop. The plasma calcium usually reaches its nadir at 48 to 72 hours after surgery and then slowly returns to normal over 2 to 3 days. For these reasons, careful postoperative monitoring of serum calcium levels is essential. For acute symptomatic hypocalcemia, calcium should be administered intravenously. Usually 20 to 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate is infused over a 15 to 20 minute period and then 50 to 100 mL are administered over the next 12 hours in adults. Calcium gluconate is less irritating to the veins than calcium chloride, and the calcium release is slower without the risk of overcorrection. Serum magnesium should always be measured and hypomagnesemia should be corrected if present. This is not the first priority for this patient. Symptoms should never be allowed to progress to the point demonstrated in this patient. Postoperative routines include careful monitoring of the serum calcium until stable. There is no evidence that this patient has a postoperative surgical problem such as a cervical hematoma. Laryngospasm and seizures are classical signs of hypocalcemia.

When the normal control of serum calcium is disturbed and there is increased autonomous production of PTH, the state is referred to as primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when there is a defect in mineral homeostasis that leads to a compensatory increase in parathyroid function. This occurs most commonly in response to renal disease, but may also develop as a consequence of the hypocalcemia associated with some diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, bone or other endocrine organs. Occasionally, with prolonged secondary stimulation, the hyperfunctioning glands are no longer physiologically responsive to an increased ionized calcium. This rare, relatively autonomous state is referred to as tertiary hyperparathyroidism and develops most commonly after renal transplantation when the defect in calcium homeostatis is corrected. The numerical values for calcium and PTH here are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Most commonly, it is the result of a single diseased gland still remaining in the neck or in the mediastinum. Recurrent disease develops after an interval of normocalcemia and may be the result of regrowth of diseased tissue, implantation from a tumor broken at the initial procedure, or even recurrent parathyroid carcinoma. Documentation of a correct initial diagnosis and review of the original operative and pathology reports are essential. It is generally agreed that localization studies do have a place in the management of recurrent disease. Noninvasive methods are employed first, and if these are unsuccessful in identifying the diseased gland, selective angiography and venous sampling for PTH are employed. Selective angiography appears to be the most accurate technique, successfully localizing 50% to 80% of parathyroid glands that cannot be detected by any other modality. Surgical reexploration can be difficult. Generally the neck is explored first after which the mediastinum is examined if this is unproductive. Surgical reexploration is successful in experienced hands in 60% to 80% of cases. There is, however, an increased incidence of complications. Unilateral recurrent nerve injury occurs in 5% to 10% of patients and permanent hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% to 20% of patients postoperatively.",

        "explanation": "The primary hormonal regulators of calcium and phosphate metabolism are parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D and calcitonin. Parathyroid hormone appears to be the single most important hormonal regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in humans. It has direct effects on the skeleton and kidney and indirect effects on the intestine, mediated through vitamin D. Sustained elevations of PTH stimulate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts leading to absorption of calcium from bone. In the kidney, PTH produces an increase in reabsorption at any given concentration of extracellular fluid calcium, although excess secretion, because of the hypercalcemia, results in a net increase in daily urinary calcium excretion. Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is produced normally by the action of sunlight on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. It is then hydroxylated in the liver (25 position) and kidney (1 position) to form the active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol). This is the active form of Vitamin D in humans. Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid protein produced by the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid. Total thyroidectomy, with removal of all the C cells, is well tolerated, and it has been concluded that calcitonin is not essential for the normal control of calcium metabolism in adult humans. Calcitonin does inhibit bone resorption and can produce hypocalcemia in experimental animals. It also increases urinary calcium and phosphate excretion.",

The earliest complaints are often vague and include muscle weakness, anorexia, nausea, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia. These nonspecific symptoms may or may not cause the patient to seek medical attention. Symptomatic patients generally have evidence of chronic disease involving the kidney or the skeleton. Renal complications develop because the hypercalcemia leads to increased urinary calcium excretion and PTH increases the excretion of phosphate. These events predispose to stone formation. Nephrolithiasis develops in about 30% of patients. Nephrocalcinosis occurs in 5% to 10% of patients. These are both nonspecific for hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid bone disease in its most classic and severe form, osteitis fibrosa cystica, is seldom seen. However, 5% to 15% of patients present with significant symptoms of skeletal disease. Only the skeletal disease is pathognomonic. Bone changes include subperiosteal resorption of bone on the radial aspect of the middle phalanx of the second or third finger. Tufting of the distal phalanges, bone cysts of the skull and long bones, “brown” tumors (i.e., localized proliferations of osteoclasts), and diffuse demineralization or granularity are seen as well.

In this regard, perhaps the most important action is the effect of steroids on protein breakdown. A direct proteolytic effect of steroids is suggested by several lines of evidence. Glucocorticoids enhance gluconeogenesis by both a direct effect on gluconeogenic hepatic enzymes and also by provision of substrate for gluconeogenesis by proteolysis. Glucocorticoid influence leads to the accentuation of lipolysis. The truncal obesity seen in steroid excess is related to the predominance of the lipogenic effect of insulin on truncal adipocytes over the lipolytic effect of glucocorticoids. The opposite relation may hold for the receptors in fat of the extremities and would explain the comparatively scant fat in these areas with steroid excess. The most notable effect of glucocorticoids in the intestinal tract is a decrease in the rate of mucosal cell replication. In addition, decreased mucosal and pancreatic prostaglandin synthesis occur. This may have important implications for the cytoprotective mechanisms in the stomach.",

Once hypersecretion is demonstrated, the specific type of pathology producing a syndrome must be determined with the aid of functional tests and relevant scanning and imaging. The most efficient and sensitive means of screening in a patient suspected of having a pheochromocytoma, (as indicated here) is measurement of the catecholamines or metabolic products thereof in the urine. Although 24-hour samples can smooth out the possible episodic variations in catecholamine secretion, shorter sampling periods can be useful, especially if corrected for creatinine excretion. Timing of the collection is critical in patients who have only episodic hypertension. Urine collection should be started immediately after a suspected attack of hypertension. Fluctuations in plasma catecholamine concentrations are much greater than those in urinary excretion, even in normal subjects. Plasma determinations are quite sensitive and specific with radioimmunoassays and HPLC determination of plasma catecholamines, but the specificity can be low because of the overlap of normal spikes in catecholamine concentrations with concentrations produced by minimally secreting pheochromocytomas. MRI and MIBG imaging studies are both potentially useful after catecholamine excess is confirmed. MRI demonstrates anatomy quite well.

          "B"
        ],
        "explanation": "Although ultrasonography is the least expensive of the imaging procedures, its value is limited by the relative inaccessibility of the adrenal gland and by the small size of some adrenal lesions. CT is the technique most commonly used to examine patients in whom adrenal abnormalities are suspected. CT reliably detects adrenal tumors greater than 1 cm in diameter. The sensitivity of CT for tumors that are 1 cm in diameter is about 80% and reaches 100% for tumors that are 3 to 4 cm. Although CT is noninvasive and reasonably sensitive, it is nonspecific. It does not distinguish functioning from nonfunctioning tumors, nor benign from malignant tumors with any degree of reliability. MRI has developed a certain usefulness even after retrenchment from early optimistic predictions. MRI is more expensive and requires greater patient cooperation than CT, but it has greater versatility because of the use of TI-and T2-weighted images. In some cases, the T2-weighted images are capable of providing a differential diagnosis and may distinguish such entities as metastatic or primary carcinoma and pheochromocytoma from adenomas, lipomas, myelolipomas and cysts. In a sense, MRI is complementary to CT in that the latter can better detect the lesion while the former can distinguish one type of lesion from the other. In addition, MRI is probably better than CT for distinguishing anatomic relationships and the extent of involvement of the surrounding tissues. Two radiopharmaceuticals have proved useful in imaging the adrenal gland. Adrenocortical lesions can be imaged by NP-59 which is taken up as cholesterol in the adrenocortical steroidogenic pathway. The other agent is MIBG, a norepinephrine analogue. It indicates norepinephrine accumulation in storage vesicles and can detect sympathoadrenal tumors at any site in the body. NP-59 can localize the adrenal cortex and any functioning tumors. It can distinguish adrenocortical hyperplasia from functioning adenomas or carcinomas. MIBG is a useful agent in localizing pheochromocytomas throughout the body, especially when the tumors are multiple, extraadrenal, recurrent, or metastatic. Arteriography, venography and selective venous sampling have become less popular as experience with other imaging techniques has become greater. Disadvantages inherent in invasive procedures using intravascular contrast agents are obvious. Arteriography is specifically dangerous in the study of patients with pheochromocytomas.",

The most efficient and sensitive means of screening for pheochromocytoma is measurement of the catecholamines, or metabolic products thereof, in the urine. The catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine, are excreted in amounts under 100 µg/d in the normal person. Because of some overlap in values, specificity can be improved by using a normal range of up to 250 mg/d. The measurement of plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone level is helpful in evaluating patients with hyperaldosteronism, as it is an intermediate product in its synthesis. The 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels are above 100 mg/dL in virtually all patients with aldosterone producing adenomas. The plasma value for this patient is normal. Perioperative treatment with either spironolactone and potassium replacement is appropriate for patients with hyperaldosteronism, but not pheochromocytoma. Nonoperative treatment of pheochromocytoma is generally unsatisfactory and entails pharmacologic blockade of the effects of catecholamines. Phenoxybenzamine and prazosin are two preferred agents that block the a-adrenergic effects of the catecholamines preoperatively with pheochromocytoma. The use of b-adrenergic blockers, such as labetalol, may be required in those patients with obvious b-adrenergic effects, such as resting pulse rates above 100 beats/min. Because of the potential for wide swings in blood pressure and other effects of chronic catecholamine secretion, careful preoperative preparation is required in patients with pheochromocytoma. It is customary to institute a-adrenergic blockade 2 to 3 weeks before anticipated surgery. This has beneficial effects of controlling blood pressure and allowing restoration of a decreased blood volume. It is the consensus that preoperative preparation in the manner makes the intraoperative management of the patient much more safe. In patients who require b-adrenergic blockade, it is essential to first establish good a-adrenergic blockade. These patients are prone to cardiac failure induced by b-adrenergic blockade because of the cardiomyopathy that may preexist. b-Adrenergic blockade in the cardiomyopathic patient with failure to first reduce the afterload by a-adrenergic blockade, can precipitate cardiac failure.",

Administration of a single dose of 2 mg of dexamethasone suppresses plasma cortisol and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids by at least half when compared to control values from untreated normal patients (low dose suppression test). In Cushing disease, with a setpoint of ACTH secretion higher than normal, low-dose dexamethasone is insufficient to suppress ACTH. High-dose dexamethasone suppression is achieved by 2 mg of dexamethasone administered every 6 hours for 24 hours. A normal response is to lower the 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion by more than one half. In the case of Cushing disease, the hypothalamic steroid receptors that allow negative feedback are intact but at a higher setpoint. In this case, 17-hydroxycorticosteroid secretion does decrease significantly after high-dose dexamethasone administration. Adrenal tumors, other causes of ectopic production of ACTH, and most cases of nodular hyperplasia do not respond to dexamethasone suppression with a decrease in steroid secretion. With an adrenal tumor, pituitary ACTH is already suppressed; therefore, dexamethasone cannot suppress it further. With ectopic ACTH secretion, the tissue producing ACTH has no receptors for steroids and thus negative feedback cannot be achieved. Therefore, high dose dexamethasone suppression will differentiate hypercortisolism of pituitary and adrenal origins. Potentially the most helpful new test for this purpose uses the administration of recombinant CRH to release ACTH and consequently to stimulate cortisol secretion. CRH (1 mg/kg) is administered intravenously, and serial blood samples obtained for 3 hours after administration. The normal pituitary adrenal axis responds by a moderate increase in ACTH and cortisol. With Cushing disease, the ACTH and cortisol rise are accentuated. With adrenal autonomous production of cortisol and with ectopic ACTH production, there is virtually no response to CRH.",

They promote midline migration of the labial folds and fusion of these folds to form the scrotum. To complete the male transformation, the urethral opening migrates to the tip of the phallus. All of these events are androgen-dependent. Since the normal female fetus does not secrete androgens, the genital tubercle, labial folds, and urethral opening all remain in the female position in this circumstance. Thus the female phenotype is associated with the absence of fetal sex hormone production. Excess androgen in the female fetus causes neonatal virilization, as is seen with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The male infant with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is likely to have a normal appearance of the external genitalia as a neonate. Precocious puberty will develop over a period of years in this latter circumstance.",

It originates from the anterior pituitary gland and is regulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The regulation of CRH is controlled by various neural influences. These include intrinsic central nervous system influences and a negative feedback inhibition by cortisol. Although there is some evidence of a short-loop feedback of ACTH on CRH, both slow and fast feedback by cortisol on the pituitary release mechanism are the primary sources of clinically relevant CRH regulation. The steroidogenic pathway involves the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and then either to the adrenal androgens or cortisol via several intermediates. The 17-ketosteroids reflect adrenal androgen synthesis while the 17-hydroxysteroids reflect cortisol synthesis. Renin is produced predominantly in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney where it acts locally and is released into the systemic circulation. Renin cleaves angiotensin I, a decapeptide derived from the liver which serves as renin substrate. Angiotensin I undergoes enzymatic cleavage in the lung to angiotensin II, which is the biologically active form of the peptide. The plasma half-life of ACTH is short (measured in minutes) with a rapid onset of action. This is in contrast to a longer plasma half-life and a slower onset of action for cortisol itself.",

The ability to measure catecholamines in the plasma has made possible the clonidine suppression test. In patients without pheochromocytoma, clonidine suppresses high basal plasma concentrations into the normal range, whereas concentrations in patients with pheochromocytoma are not suppressed. Another use of plasma catecholamine measurements is in examining the ratio of 3,4-dihydroxyphenoglycol (DHPG) to norepinephrine in plasma. DHPG is released from the chromaffin cells and adrenergic neurons to a much greater extent than norepinephrine in pheochromocytoma patients compared with patients who have essential hypertension, i.e. the ratio of DHPG to norepinephrine is higher in patients with pheochromocytomas. NP-59 (131I-6 b-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol) is taken up as cholesterol by the adrenal cortex and is incorporated in the adrenocortical steroidogenic pathway.

These changes are sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus and by the macula densa and act through the renin angiotensin system. At least two other factors influence aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone secretion is directly related to the serum potassium concentration. An increase in serum potassium directly stimulates aldosterone production, whereas a decrease in serum potassium has the opposite effect. Because of its early point of action in the steroidogenic pathway, ACTH also increases secretion of aldosterone, although it is much less potent in this regard than in its stimulation of cortisol. The stimulatory effects of potassium and ACTH on aldosterone secretion can be overcome by angiotensin II stimulation. Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by mineralocorticoid hypersecretion which promotes a positive sodium balance and hypokalemia. About 80% of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism have serum potassium levels of 3.5 mEq/L or less. Causes of secondary hyperaldosteronism are related to increased renin secretion.

        "explanation": "The treatment of adrenal tumors is primarily surgical removal. Although pharmaceutical agents are useful in preparing the patient for surgery or in palliating the patient with recurrent adrenal carcinoma, no agents render definitive therapy for adrenal tumors. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia stands alone among the primary, hyperfunctioning adrenal syndromes that are amenable to medical therapy for definitive treatment. Functioning benign lesions of the adrenal cortex that are not ACTH dependent, such as adenomas or macronodular hyperplasia, respond to metyrapone and aminoglutethimide, which are inhibitors of enzymes in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway. Both agents can effect a decrease in the production of cortisol when there is no increase in ACTH secondary to feedback stimulation. These drugs are not satisfactory long-term agents because of their high incidence of drug reactions, patient noncompliance, and continued growth of the lesions. They may be useful in patients whose surgery must be delayed. Although malignant, functioning adrenocortical lesions should be debulked whenever possible. Several chemotherapy agents offer adjunct therapy. The most noteworthy is mitotane (o,p,-DDD). This is a cytolytic agent that has a 30% to 70% response rate in terms of decreasing steroid output. Unfortunately, patient survival is not affected. As mentioned, nonoperative treatment with cortisone acetate and possibly fludrocortisone is definitive therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Cushing disease is best treated by transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma. Pheochromoctyoma requires definitive surgical resection although the preoperative pharmacologic preparation with catecholamine blockade is required.",

The posterior pituitary, the neurohypophysis, constitutes the remainder and should be considered virtually an extension of the hypothalamus of the brain. The pituitary resides within bony confines of the sella turcica (Turkish saddle) and is bordered laterally by the cavernous sinuses (venous), inferiorly and anteriorly by the sphenoid sinus (air), posteriorly by the dorsum sella and superiorly by the membranous diaphragma sella. The cavernous sinuses each contain the siphon region of the internal carotid artery and portions of the cranial nerves III, IV, V and VI all within the venous plexus. The optic chiasm lies immediately above the diaphragma sella. Directly below the anterior and inferior portions of the sella is the aerated sphenoid sinus. This is sufficiently large in 97% of the patients to allow a transnasal, transsphenoidal surgical approach to the pituitary. The adenohypophysis is regulated by a portal venous system between the median eminence of the hypothalamus and the adenohypophysis itself. This system involves a transport of (1) thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), to stimulate the secretion of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); (2) corticotropin-releasing hormone, to stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); (3) growth hormone-releasing hormone, to stimulate secretion of growth hormone (GH); (4) gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); and (5) prolactin-inhibitory factor (dopamine), to inhibit prolactin. The neurohypophysis is regulated by means of direct transport of hormones through nerve fibers from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus. The neurohypophysis is a virtual extension of the hypothalamus. Products of the neurohypophysis are antidiuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin) and oxytocin.

In normal patients, 1 to 2 hours after the oral administration of 100 g of glucose, the growth hormone level falls well below 5 ng/mL. This suppression is not seen with GH-secreting adenomas, and often a paradoxical rise in GH is observed. The goals of treatment are to lower the circulating growth hormone or somatomedin C levels to within a normal range and to reduce the size of the mass lesion causing compression-related symptoms.

The growth of a tumor in the relatively unrestricted upward direction is much more common and often results in compression of the optic chiasm with the resultant loss of vision, typically a bitemporal hemianopsia. Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas often present with endocrine symptoms including amenorrhea and galactorrhea in women. In men, the loss of libido, infertility and visual loss are typical. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved as the first choice for diagnostic imaging and is often the only tool needed to reach a therapeutic decision with regard to pituitary adenomas. With intravenous infusion of a paramagnetic substance such as gadolinium, MRI demonstrates intrasellar tumors as small as 5 mm. In addition, the extent of suprasellar and sphenoid sinus extension, as well as lateral extension into the cavernous sinuses, is demonstrable. Cysts and hemorrhage can be differentiated, as can blood flowing within an aneurysm. CT scanning has a place in pituitary imaging if MRI scanning is unavailable. Plain skull X-rays are not needed generally. Cerebral angiography is performed only if an aneurysm is suspected or if a lesion is so large that occlusion or compression of the internal carotid artery is in question. For this patient, the symptoms clearly point to a central nervous system, pituitary etiology rather than abdominal end organ failure with regard to the amenorrhea.",

Adenomas may show a variable staining pattern with conventional hematoxylin and eosin dyes, so it is difficult to classify adenomas based on these stains. Immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural studies and in situ hybridization analyses for specific hormones are the most reliable methods of classifying pituitary adenomas today. Immunohistochemical staining of pituitary adenomas with specific antibodies has reliably classified adenomas using highly purified polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against prolactin, GH, ACTH, FSH-b LH-b, and TSH-b. Many studies with these antibodies have revealed that some pituitary tumors are composed of several cell types, which produce various hormones. Some adenomas may not store specific hormones, so immunohistochemical staining may be weak or absent. The mRNA is usually present in the cytoplasm of adenomas. Localization of mRNA for specific protein hormones is becoming more widely used in the classification of pituitary adenomas. Null-cell adenomas constitute up to 25% of pituitary neoplasms. Selective venous sampling from the inferior petrosal sinus via transfemoral catherization is an effective method to compare venous effluent from the pituitary to systemic levels for a specific hormone. In addition, this technique may demonstrate laterality. This latter issue is potentially important as certain small adenomas may not be discernible from the gross appearance at surgery.",

If no tumor is identified, then a decision must be made as to whether to resect all or a portion of the gland. If the endocrine evidence is convincing for pituitary origin and the patient has no desire to have children, then total hypophysectomy is warranted. If the petrosal sinus sampling clearly indicates laterality then appropriate hemiresection of the gland may be done. About 75% of patients have microadenomas as the source of ACTH secretion. The postoperative remission rate in these patients is 88% to 96%, and the long-term recurrence rate appears to be no more than 5%. 10% to 20% of patients who undergo exploration have macroadenomas, and the postoperative remission rates in these patients have been reported to be from 33% to 61%. Most of these patients require postoperative radiation therapy. Patients who fail both surgery and radiation require either surgical adrenalectomy or medical suppression of adrenal function.",

        "explanation": "The findings of Cushing Syndrome often include central obesity, hypertension, hirsutism, fatigue, easy bruisability, stria, moon-like facies, dorsal fat pad, and often depression or other mental changes. Less common abnormalities include headache, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, galactorrhea, peripheral edema and amenorrhea. Often, a patient presents without the classic cushingoid appearance and complains only of severe fatigue or depression. The cause of hypercortisolism is an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) in up to 80% of cases, with remainder due either to an adrenocortical tumor or to an ectopic neoplasm secreting ACTH or corticotropin-releasing factor. Pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism is much more common in women(80%) and an ectopic etiology more common in men. Up to 60% of patients with pituitary etiologies have nondiagnostic imaging studies, therefore, the diagnosis often relies completely on endocrine testing. Multiple measurements of cortisol and ACTH to evaluate the diurnal pattern are important but often misleading. They are mainly of value when clearly elevated. The determination of urinary free cortisol excretion over 24 hours is an extremely important measurement. If the overnight dexamethasone screening test yields an 8 AM serum cortisol level of less than 5 ug/dl, then hypercortisolism is rarely present. Generally, patients with a pituitary etiology of hypercortisolism do not show suppression with the low-dose dexamethasone test, but do with the higher dose test. Patients with adrenal or ectopic etiologies do not experience suppression with either dose. Chest and abdominal CT scans are appropriate to look for adrenal or lung tumors. The most specific test when the MRI is negative and evidence implicates the pituitary, is simultaneous measurement of ACTH levels in both inferior petrosal sinuses and a concurrent determination of the peripheral ACTH level. This approach produces specific information about the existence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor and even the laterality of the tumor.",

The advantages of continuous cardiac output monitoring, as compared with intermittent methods, are (1) previously undetected events may be unmasked; (2) more prompt recognition of adverse events may be achieved; and (3) earlier therapeutic intervention may be possible. Continuous cardiac output monitoring using the thermodilution method appears to be as accurate as the “standard” intermittent bolus method, but it does not require fluid injectates. In this method, a modified pulmonary artery catheter incorporating a thermal filament heats blood in the right ventricle at pulsed intervals, and a distal thermistor detects the temperature change, which can be related mathematically to cardiac output. The Fick method combines respiratory gas analysis with oximetery to determine oxygen consumption (V(overdot)O 2) and to estimate mixed venous and arterial oxygen content differences, respectively. Cardiac output (CO) is then determined from the formula: CO = V(overdot)O 2/ {C(a-v)O 2 × 10} @ V(overdot)O 2/ {SaO 2 - SvO 2) × (Hb) × (1.39) × 10}. Thoracic electrical bioimpedance is a technique by which the resistance to a small-amplitude alternating current (i.e., the impedance) is measured using various electrodes. The impedance change induced by each cardiac ejection is a function of the stroke volume, which then can be used to calculate the cardiac output.",

Intrinsic causes such as myocardial dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease, or extrinsic causes such as pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and pericardial tamponade, may produce cardiogenic shock. Principles of treatment of cardiogenic shock are aimed at optimizing preload, cardiac contractility, and afterload. Preload is usually adequate or high in cardiogenic shock. Dobutamine is a useful inotropic agent, particularly when filling pressures are high, because of its mild vasodilatory effect, as well as its effect to enhance cardiac contractility. Afterload-reducing agents, such as sodium nitroprusside, may be beneficial in cardiogenic shock in the setting of elevated filling pressures, low cardiac output, and elevated systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output may improve with use of afterload-reducing agents by decreasing myocardial wall tension and optimizing the myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), by providing diastolic augmentation, reducing left ventricular afterload, and reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, is sometimes useful in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. The IABP is especially useful in low–cardiac output postcardiotomy patients, in patients awaiting revascularization, and in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by mitral insufficiency or ventricular septal defect. The pneumatic antishock garment (PASG), which causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance, is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock.",

The pulmonary artery catheter can provide important hemodynamic and oxygen transport data that are very useful in directing therapy aimed at optimizing cardiac function and oxygen delivery. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure readings should be made at end-expiration to minimize ventilatory artifacts. Continuous SvO 2 monitoring, an accurate, reliable method that combines pulmonary artery catheterization with the technique of reflectance spectrophotometry, may provide early warning signs of hemodynamic compromise or inadequate oxygen delivery. Gastrointestinal tonometry provides information that allows one to infer the adequacy of splanchnic tissue perfusion. In this technique, intramucosal pH is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and measurements of gut intraluminal PCO 2 and arterial bicarbonate concentration. Serum lactate concentration may be monitored in shock to detect metabolic acidosis associated with anaerobic metabolism; however, mild to moderate hyperlactatemia may also be seen with liver disease, toxin ingestion, and hypermetabolic states not associated with shock.",

Pericardial tamponade may initially respond to volume administration by enhancing preload. Pericardiocentesis may need to be performed emergently if hemodynamic instability persists after an initial fluid bolus when signs of compressive cardiogenic shock are present.

The two-hit theory holds that the systemic inflammatory response is amplified following the second hit, such as nosocomial pneumonia, leading to exaggerated, persistent release of inflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathogenesis of MODS. The liver appears to be a pivotal organ in the progression and outcome of MODS, partly because of the activation and prolonged stimulation of the Kupffer cells, which comprise the majority of the body's macrophage population. Macrophages are known to play a critical role in the elaboration of numerous inflammatory mediators.

A decrease in the pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) may be observed with losses of 15% to 30% of blood volume. Treatment of hemorrhagic shock includes intravascular fluid administration and definitive control of the source of the hemorrhage. Inotropic agents should not be started before volume resuscitation but may be added to improve oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues if volume administration alone does not produce resuscitative goals.

Occasionally, myocardial depression may be seen, characterized by increased ventricular volumes and decreased ejection fractions. A circulating myocardial depressant factor, possibly TNF, may be responsible for the cardiac dysfunction in such instances. The cause of the increased SvO 2 frequently observed in septic patients is unclear, but it may be secondary to bioenergetic failure, metabolic downregulation, or microcirculatory maldistribution leading to physiologic shunting. True anatomic arteriovenous shunting has not been demonstrated in humans in septic shock. Treatment of septic shock consists of appropriate antibiotic use and supportive therapy.

In pathophysiologic processes associated with inflammation, injury, and infection, oxidants may be generated by activated neutrophils and in ischemia-reperfusion injury. During ischemia, the enzyme xanthine oxidase accumulates. When oxygen availability increases during reperfusion, O 2• is formed in a reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase. Further oxidant formation ensues, causing the production of H 2O 2 and the extremely reactive hydroxyl ion (OH•). Oxidants may cause direct cell damage by the mechanisms of lipid peroxidation and cell membrane disruption, inhibition of ATP synthesis, reduction of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and oxidative damage to DNA and amino acids.

The splanchnic circulation is very vulnerable to the circulatory redistribution that occurs in shock, thus, gut ischemia may occur early in the various shock syndromes. Gut injury, as a result of ischemia or reperfusion injury, leads to disruption in the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased gut permeability. Translocation of enteric flora or bacterial toxins across the gut wall may then occur, resulting in amplification of the systemic inflammatory response and the development of multiple organ dysfunction. Gut dysfunction, therefore, may perpetuate the inflammatory process. Various methods have been tried to modulate the deleterious effects of gut dysfunction. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract by oral antibiotics has been shown to reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonias, but no improvement in mortality has been demonstrated thus far with this controversial technique. Early enteral nutrition probably has the biggest impact on the preservation of gut architecture and function.

The next in rank may be properly debated between answer D and answer C. D, right hemicolectomy, is judged to have somewhat greater likelihood of complications since the patient is older, smokes, and is obese, although the procedure may be done through a transverse or lower abdominal incision. C, vagotomy and pyloroplasty, is viewed as being somewhat less serious since it is an upper abdominal operation on an elective basis in a 50-year-old whose only abnormalities include old, healed tuberculosis on a chest film. A very low risk of pulmonary complication should follow a transabdominal hysterectomy done through a lower abdominal incision in a woman whose only risk factors are obesity and a 3-hour anesthesia time. The lowest risk probably resides with the younger patient undergoing modified radical mastectomy, whose only risk factor is obesity.

The second most important evaluation is the hemoglobin concentration, which in this patient may show an anemia related to chronic alimentary tract blood loss that would require correction prior to safe induction of a general anesthetic. Arterial blood gases vary from individual to individual depending primarily on smoking habits and age. Accordingly, each older person should have a resting baseline determination prior to operation. Serum creatinine may show evidence of occult renal disease and is substantially more useful than blood urea nitrogen, which is more vulnerable to transient volume changes. Carcinoembryonic antigen is important to know in many patients with cancer with respect to postoperative follow-up since in some cases it may be an early herald of recurrent disease. However, it has little to do with the patient's preoperative assessment in terms of risk and preparation for an elective operation. The presence of liver metastases, for example, can be discovered with significant accuracy by palpation at the time of operation, and an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen in no set of circumstances would lead one to withhold colon resection with its relief of potential obstruction and bleeding. Finally, serum sodium concentration in a 65-year-old woman who is admitted electively for resection of the colon is always normal and would be of least value among these tests.",

This includes situations in which the patient is unable to compensate for a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity by the usual mechanisms, such as increased cardiac output. Such patients develop myocardial dysfunction if an excessive demand is placed on the heart. The patient should be transfused with packed red blood cells, which afford added oxygen-carrying capacity. This decreases the workload on the myocardium while providing the necessary oxygen-delivery capability. The use of packed red blood cells to improve wound healing or to improve the patient's sense of well-being is highly questionable. No data support such a practice. In general, the use of a transfusion trigger such as a hematocrit of 30% or hemoglobin of 10 gm. per dl. constitutes a questionable indication for transfusion. If a patient is asymptomatic and stable and has no risk of myocardial ischemia, packed red blood cell transfusion should not be given based solely or predominantly on a numerical value such as a hematocrit of 28%.",

Most such reactions occur if a type O person receives type A red cells owing to a clerical error that occurs either at the time the blood sample was drawn, during processing in the laboratory, or at the time a unit is administered. The importance of extremely careful labeling, transfer, and handling of specimens and of cross-matched blood products cannot be overemphasized. Allergic and other reactions are common but rarely fatal. The transmission of bacterial organisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) has been reported especially with platelet concentrates maintained at or near room temperature. Fortunately, such reactions are rare.",

Tissue factor then tightly binds factor VII circulating in the plasma and activates the coagulation cascade. Factor VIII and factor IX deficiency cause the clinical syndromes of hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. Both of these disorders involve very severe clinical bleeding disorders, whereas deficiencies of factor XII do not generally cause clinically significant bleeding.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: It is not necessarily true that enteral nutrition is safer than parenteral nutrition, and it may in fact be associated with a higher risk of death than parenteral nutrition. Specifically, a well-run parenteral nutrition service should not be associated with significant mortality, except for the occasional death due to undetected yeast infection. On the other hand, enteral nutrition, especially if not carried out safely, can result in significant mortality. The most common of the severe complications of enteral nutrition result from the gastrostomy, or tube feedings into the stomach. Sudden changes in gastric motility, such as those associated with sepsis, may result in aspiration. Nasoenteric or nasoduodenal tubes help prevent this complication, as does shutting off enteral feedings between the hours of 11 P.M. and 7 A.M. It is also essential to keep the patient's head elevated 30 degrees. Also necessary is the use of extreme care when initiating enteral nutrition. If hypertonic material is given into the stomach, one can increase osmolality followed by an increase in volume. If, however, the material is given into the small bowel, volume must be increased first and then tonicity, with the expectation that osmolality greater than 400 or 500 mOsm per liter may never be achieved without provoking severe diarrhea. If care is not taken with the initiation of enteral nutrition, massive diarrhea may result, including fluid loss, the absorption of enormous amounts of carbohydrate into the circulation with inadequate fluid to support it, and the development of hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma. Alternatively, severe unremitting diarrhea may result in necrosis of the intestinal wall, the appearance of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, and, finally, perforation and death. All of these complications may be prevented by judicious use of enteral nutrition with the same care one uses for parenteral nutrition.",

Though some studies have shown that the provision of glutamine in amounts up to 2% in standard parenteral nutrition solutions increases both jejunal and ileal mucosal protein content, cell wall thickness, and DNA content, this has not been the case in all studies, and this reported effect seems very dependent on experimental design. In many of the studies that have shown such an effect, 2% glutamine has been used to replace virtually all nonessential amino acids, probably initiating a deficiency state. The beneficial effects seen with glutamine are far less impressive than those seen with epidermal growth factor, for example, and disappear entirely when a different experimental design is used in which 2% glutamine is added to an adequate amino acid formulation in which glutamine does not replace nonessential amino acids but is added to them. Nonetheless, the use of enterocyte-specific fuels, specifically glutamine, is potentially exciting and should be carefully investigated. More striking are the results that follow massive bowel resection, radiation enteritis, and chemotherapy toxicity. Glutamine may help the small bowel regenerate more quickly, enabling more rapid use of the small bowel for nutrition. It should be pointed out, however, that glutamine is a fuel utilized by many tumors and, thus, one runs the risk of stimulating the growth of the tumor with excessive glutamine. The short-chain fatty acids, produced from bacterial fermentation of soluble pectin, may be useful in both the maintenance of colonocyte-specific nutrition and, in the case of butyrate, ileal enterocyte nutrition.",

The effect of essential amino acids in preventing a rise in BUN, as well as its beneficial effect in preventing hyperkalemia, may obviate dialysis in such patients.

According to this hypothesis, the imbalance between aromatic and branched-chain amino acids in the plasma results in abnormally high levels of the toxic aromatic amino acids in the brain, thus provoking hepatic encephalopathy. The use of modified amino acid mixtures, with glucose as the calorie base, has been associated in a number of studies with improvement in encephalopathy. Meta-analysis has concluded that the use of such solutions is indicated as therapy for hepatic encephalopathy but has been proposed only for hepatic encephalopathy complicating acute exacerbation of chronic liver disease. Although there are a few anecdotal reports of beneficial effects on hepatic encephalopathy of acute fulminant hepatitis, the use of such a solution has not been advocated, but such a modified solution is tolerated better than standard amino acid mixtures in patients requiring TPN. In some studies, particularly in complicated surgical cases, the use of a high–branched-chain, low–aromatic amino acid solution has been associated with lower mortality. These statements are true only for studies in which the modified solutions are given with hypertonic glucose as a calorie base. Studies in which lipid was the principal calorie source have not revealed such improvements in mortality.

        "correct": [
          "B"
        ],
        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The problem with the patient with cancer is a very vexing one. Clearly, one of the metabolic effects of cancer, cachexia, affects patients in the last quartile of their disease and makes such patients intolerant of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and, in many cases, operative procedures. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been proposed as a means of reversing cachexia and enabling patients to better tolerate surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In experimental animals, it is clear that the provision of calories and protein, especially in excessive amounts, is associated with the more rapid growth of tumors and decreased survival, especially in the group that is overfed in the extreme. There is also evidence suggesting that overfeeding, or at least TPN, may result in increased growth (or at least change cell kinetics) in patients who are overnourished with TPN. Of the randomized prospective trials that have been carried out, no trial utilizing chemotherapy or radiation therapy has revealed a survival advantage for patients receiving TPN. Indeed, in Shamberger's study, there is a suggestion that the tumor-free interval following treatment of lymphoma may be shorter in patients receiving TPN. In patients undergoing surgery, however, especially those who are severely malnourished (as recently revealed in the VA study) or in patients with major procedures such as esophagogastrectomy (as in Muller's study), evidence suggests that TPN is beneficial. In a late follow-up in Muller's study, there was no apparent increase in recurrence, and the survival rate was the same, despite much higher mortality in the non-TPN group. This suggests that any improved survival following operation may have been offset by an increased late recurrence rate, although it is difficult to reach this conclusion. In summary, for patients with cancer TPN probably nourishes the tumor as well as the host. Nonetheless, in severely malnourished patients provision of TPN from 5 to 10 days preoperatively may increase survival and decrease morbidity. Overfeeding must be avoided. Future studies will undoubtedly reveal that there are certain nutrients that tumors require, which probably should be best avoided.",

If one examines the conditions under which Askanazi's patients were studied, these were a group of septic, depleted patients who were taken from almost no nutritional support to a caloric supply of 2.25 times their caloric requirement, most of the calories consisting of glucose. Suffice it to say that, in patients with impaired respiratory function, one should measure VCO2 and, when VCO2 is significantly elevated and appears to interfere with weaning, decrease the amount of glucose calories and increase the amount of fat.

Unlike the hepatic abnormalities in children, which may progress to cholestasis, liver damage, and in some cases death, hepatic steatosis, or fatty infiltration of the liver with triglycerides, appears to be a rather benign complication. It may be, but is not necessarily, associated with hepatic enzymatic abnormalities, which usually occur in the first week, peak at the third week, and generally disappear by the sixth week of parenteral nutrition. Abnormalities in the transaminases are most common, with alkaline phosphatase also being elevated, but there is no correlation between the degree of fatty infiltration and enzymatic abnormalities. Fatty infiltration appears to be largely vacuolization with increased storage of triglycerides. Hepatic steatosis is almost always associated with an overload of glucose. Recent studies in experimental animals have suggested that the portal insulin-glucagon ratio, which is elevated under these circumstances, may be causally related to hepatic steatosis. Insulin is the leading storage enzyme and is responsible for lipogenesis. The presence of insulin inhibits lipolysis. Glucagon, on the other hand, results in the mobilization of hepatic lipid. The liver “sees” the portal vein insulin-glucagon ratio. Excesses of insulin elicited by hypertonic dextrose increase lipid deposition in the liver, whereas glucagon, which is elicited by certain amino acids, results in the mobilization of hepatic lipid.",

Although anemia was once believed to be a significant cause of wound disruption, studies have shown that, in the absence of malnutrition or hypovolemia, anemia with a hematocrit greater than 15% does not interfere with wound healing. In contrast, molecular oxygen is critical for collagen synthesis because it is one of the factors required for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline. Also, hypoxia favors wound infection. The role of age in collagen synthesis is not clear, but the incidence of wound failure and incisional hernias is greater in patients older than 60. Fibroplasia occurs at a slower rate in older animals. Perhaps more than any other factor, wound infection is associated with the risk of wound failure.",

In general, linear incisions heal without scar until late in gestation, whereas excisional wounds heal with scar at an earlier gestational age. The profiles of fetal proteoglycans, collagens, and growth factors are different from those in adult wounds. The less differentiated state of fetal skin is probably an important characteristic responsible for scarless repair. There is minimal inflammation and angiogenesis in fetal wounds. Fetal wounds are characterized by high levels of hyaluronic acid and its stimulator(s) with more rapid, highly organized collagen deposition. The roles of peptide growth factors such as TGF-b and basic fibroblast growth factor are less prominent in fetal than in adult wound healing.

Despite the fact that they are constantly bathed by fluid that is precisely the opposite composition. Even more impressive is the distribution of ionized calcium. The extracellular concentration of this ion is typically of the order of 10–3M, whereas that of cytosol is typically 10–7M, a 10,000-fold gradient. Such nonequilibrium ion distributions are even more remarkable in light of the fact that the plasma membrane is, to varying degrees, leaky to ions such as sodium, potassium and calcium. The plasma membrane is leaky to a variety of substances, but it exhibits an astonishing ability to discriminate or select one substance over another. This selectivity relates to not only ions but also for organic compounds such as glucose.

Together these subunits form an ion-selected pore that can be gated by a change in transmembrane electrical potential or binding of a ligand to one of the subunits. Catalytic receptors are membrane proteins that possess enzymatic activity. The best understood receptors of this class are the tyrosine kinases. The largest family of cell surface receptors are the G-protein-linked receptors. G-proteins are a family of proteins that bind and hydrolyze GTP. The final component of single transduction by G-protein-linked cell surface receptors is the effector that generates the intracellular messenger.

Ion channels are permissive transport elements. Ions flow through a channel only through the presence of an appropriate driving force. Ion channels do not conduct all the time, rather the channel protein undergoes conformational changes between a conducting (open) state and nonconducting (closed) state.

Each tRNA carries only one amino acid and must be recognized by a distinct enzyme which catalyzes the covalent attachment of the carboxyl end of the amino acid to the end of the tRNA in a process using ATP. Protein synthesis occurs by the formation of a peptide bond between the carboxyl terminal of the growing peptide chain and the free amino acid of deactivated amino acid tRNA. This event does not occur in free solution, but within ribosomes. Ribosomes are protein synthesizing machines that bring all of the necessary components together in the correct sequence and spacial orientation. Protein synthesis consumes a great deal of energy because four high-energy phosphate bonds must be split to make each peptide bond.

In endocrine regulation, the extracellular messengers (hormones) are released into the blood and act on target cells anywhere on the body that has appropriate receptors. In neurocrine regulation, neurons secrete transmitters into highly localized regions, the synaptic cleft, so that the regulation depends on a physical connection between the neuron and the target cell as well as the presence of a specific receptor. In almost all cases of cell regulation, the extracellular signal or stimulus is restricted to being an informational molecule. This information is received by receptor on or in the target cell, which generally has an affinity for the signal molecule. Most hormones, local mediators, and neurotransmitters are water-soluble and cannot readily cross the plasma membrane. 88 Proteins that are destined to be secreted from the cells must pass through a series of organelles.

The endoplasmic reticulum is the network of interconnected membranes forming closed vesicles, tubules, and saccules. The endoplasmic reticulum has a number of functions and is primarily involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids. Adjacent to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and functionally involved in the sorting and package of secreted protein is the Golgi complex. Lysosomes are membrane-limited organelles containing acid hydrolytic enzymes that degrade polymers such as proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.",

The initial products of transcription are known as heterogeneous nuclear RNA because of their large size variation. These primary transcripts are then processed to form mRNA. RNA splicing accounts for mature RNA being much shorter than nuclear RNA. Moreover, alternative splicing can lead to the production of different mRNA molecules and in some cases different proteins from the same gene. mRNA is exported from the nucleus only after processing is complete.",

The major occluding junction is the tight junction or zonula occludens which connects cells in epithelia and thereby allows epithelia to serve as selective permeability barriers. Tight junctions are normally located near the apical pool of the cell and form a belt that completely encircles the cell. Anchoring junctions connect the cytoskeleton of the cell to the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells. Morphologically these are adherens junctions or desmosomes. Desmosomes are button-like points of attachment with a prominent intracellular plaque that serves to weld together adjacent cells by serving as anchoring sites for intermediate filaments within the cell. The third functional type of cell junction is a gap junction which is specialized for communication. This junction mediates both electrical and chemical coupling. 95 Examples of ion channel blockers include: Channel blockade is an important mechanism of action for toxins and some therapeutic agents. The deadly toxin of the puffer fish, tetrodotoxin, acts by blocking the Na+ channels that are responsible for the conduction of nerve impulse. The diuretic, amiloride, acts by blocking the Na+ channels that inhabit the apical membrane of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron.

        "explanation": "Although most hormone and other messenger receptors are extracellular, intracellular receptors have been identified. The hormone messengers involved for these receptors are primarily steroid and thyroid hormones and are lipophilic. By virtue of their hydrophobic nature, they are able to readily penetrate the lipid portion of the cell membrane. Receptors for these hormones exist intracellularly in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus and generally act as regulators of gene expression. These hydrophobic signaling molecules exist in plasma bound to protein, so that the concentration of this class of regulators does not fluctuate rapidly in plasma and their actions are generally slower in onset and more prolonged than those of water-soluble class. Some types of steroid receptors, particularly for glucocorticoids, are located in the cytosol in the inactive state. Once the ligand binds, the receptor undergoes a conformational change, termed activation. This allows cytoplasmic receptors to move into the nucleus and bind to DNA. Receptors already in the nucleus increase their affinity for DNA. In the case of glucocorticoid receptors and probably others of this class, the inactive receptor is associated with another protein, the heat-shock protein. They block the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. Activation involves the dissociation of the inhibitor protein.",

TPN with amino acids of high biologic value may decrease the mortality in patients with acute renal failure. These solutions, containing high quality amino acids, can improve nitrogen balance and diminish urea nitrogen. Provision of essential amino acids only allows the body to maximally utilize nitrogen for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids and thereby helps prevent rapid rises in blood urea nitrogen. There appears to be no advantages to using essential amino acids if the patient is already being dialyzed every other day and therefore a balanced standard amino acid solution is recommended. Because of liver damage and portasystemic shunting, patients with hepatic failure develop derangements in circulating levels of amino acids. The plasma aromatic/branch chain amino acid ratio is increased favoring the transport of aromatic amino acids across the blood brain barrier. These amino acids are precursors of false transmitters which contribute to lethargy and encephalopathy. Treatment of individuals with liver failure with solutions enriched in branch chain amino acids and deficient in aromatic amino acids results in improved tolerance to administration of protein and clinical improvement in encephalopathic states. Glutamine-enriched TPN partially attenuates villous atrophy and may be useful in treatment of short gut syndrome.",

The goal of nutritional support is maintenance of body cell mass and limitation of weight loss to less than 10% preinjury. The major impact of nutritional support in the trauma patient is to aid host defense. Under-nutrition may compromise the available host defense mechanism and may thus increase the likelihood of invasive sepsis, multiple organ system failure, and death. Resuscitation, oxygenation and arrest of hemorrhage are immediate priorities for survival. Nutritional support is an essential part of the metabolic care of the critically ill patient and should be instituted after resuscitation before significant weight loss occurs. The nutritional requirements of a trauma patient can be determined by determining basal metabolic rate with appropriate increases based on extent of injury and hospital activity.

The body of literature suggests that TPN under certain circumstances may predispose patients to an increase in gut-derived infectious complications. In a study in human volunteers, individuals receiving TPN had an accentuated systemic response to endotoxin challenge compared to enterally fed volunteers. This study is consistent with impairment of gut barrier function during parenteral feedings which may promote the release of bacteria and/or cytokines leading to pronounced systemic responses and possibly multiple organ failure.",

Hormone-sensitive lipase, present only in adipose tissue, catalyzes the breakdown of stored triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids that are produced are released in the circulation. The major lipids in plasma do not circulate in a free form, thus free fatty acids must be bound to albumin. During stress, the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase is increased which leads to mobilization of fat stores.

Accelerated proteolysis, increased nitrogen excretion and prolonged negative nitrogen balance also occur following infection with a response pattern similar to that described with injury. Severe infection is often associated with a hypercatabolic state that initiates marked changes in interorgan glutamine metabolism. This process results in accelerated muscle proteolysis and net skeletal muscle glutamine release. The bulk of glutamine is taken up by the liver at the expense of the gut. It appears that sepsis can impair gut metabolism of glutamine.

In man and other animals, dietary protein is the source of most amino acids. Intestinal absorption is the only physiological pathway by which the body obtains exogenous amino acids. Digestion of ingested protein provides free amino acids that are absorbed by the small intestine and transported to the liver where they can be incorporated into new proteins or other biosynthetic products. Excess amino acids are degraded and their carbon skeleton is oxidized to produce energy or it is incorporated into glycogen or into free fatty acids. In addition to the metabolism of dietary amino acids, the existing proteins in the cell are continuously recycled, such that total protein turnover in the body is about 300 g/day. Vertebrates cannot reutilize nitrogen with 100% efficiency; therefore, obligatory nitrogen losses occur, mainly in the urine. Urinary nitrogen losses will diminish when individuals are fed a protein-free diet, but will never become 0 because of the body’s inability to completely reutilize nitrogen. In stressed patients, this ability to adapt to starvation is compromised such that proteolysis of body proteins continues at a substantial rate. This increases the amount of obligatory nitrogen losses which are accentuated by the catabolic disease states. This results in a negative nitrogen balance in which the amount of nitrogen taken in by the patient is exceeded by the amount of nitrogen lost in the urine, stool, skin, wounds, and fistula drainage.",

The development of organ failure requires changes in the nutritional requirements and creates special feeding problems. A problem associated with systemic infection is oxygenation and elimination of carbon dioxide. Most of the enteral and parenteral formulas used to provide nutritional support for critically ill patients contain large amounts of carbohydrate, which generate large amounts of carbon dioxide following oxygenation. Such a large CO2 load may worsen pulmonary function or may delay weaning from the respirator. If this factor becomes a problem, the carbohydrate load should be reduced to 50% of metabolic requirements and fat emulsion administered to provide additional calories. When renal failure becomes progressive, the use of hemodialysis minimizes the effect of uremia superimposed on the metabolism of sepsis. Metabolic studies in patients with acute and chronic renal failure have limited the intake of nonessential amino acids, in an attempt to lower urea production. Proteins of high biologic value, but in much smaller quantities than usually given, are administered along with adequate calories, usually in the form of glucose. When enteral feedings are not feasible, a central venous infusion of an essential amino acid solution and hypertonic dextrose provides calories and a small quantity of nitrogen to reduce protein catabolism while simultaneously controlling the rise in BUN. During dialysis, protein intake is liberalized, but the BUN should still be maintained below 100 mg/dl. Hepatic dysfunction is a common manifestation of septicemia. The carbohydrate load is usually reduced to consist of no more than 5% of metabolic requirements, and the additional calories should be provided as fat emulsion. If encephalopathy develops, protein load should also be reduced0.",

Glutamine is not included in most nutritional formulas and has been eliminated from TPN solutions because of its relative instability and short half life compared to other amino acids. With few exceptions, glutamine is present in oral enteral diets but only at relatively low levels characteristic of the concentration in most animal and plant stores (about 7% of total amino acids). Several recent studies, however, have demonstrated that glutamine may be an essential amino acid during critical illness, particularly as it relates to supporting the metabolic requirements of the intestinal mucosa. These studies demonstrate that dietary glutamine is not required during states of health but appears to be beneficial when glutamine depletion is severe and/or when intestinal mucosa is damaged by insults such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The addition of glutamine to enteral diet reduces the incidence of gut translocation but these improvements are dependent upon the amount of supplemental glutamine and the type of insult studied. Glutamine-enriched TPN partially attenuates villous atrophy that develops during parenteral nutrition. The use of intravenous glutamine in patients appears to be safe and effective in its ability to maintain muscle glutamine stores and improve nitrogen balance.

Several factors specific to the patient may determine the nature of the host response to stress. Body composition is a major determinant of the metabolic responses observed during surgical illness. Post-traumatic nitrogen excretion is directly related to the size of the body protein mass. A strong relationship between protein depletion and postoperative complications has been demonstrated in nonseptic, nonimmunocompromised patients undergoing elective major gastrointestinal surgery. Protein-depleted patients have significantly lower preoperative respiratory muscle strength and vital capacity, increased incidence of postoperative pneumonia, and longer postoperative hospital stay. Impaired wound healing and respiratory, hepatic, and muscle function in protein-depleted patients awaiting surgery has also been reported. Many of the changes in the metabolic responses to surgical illnesses that occur with aging can be attributed to alterations in body composition and to long-standing patterns of physical activity. Fat mass tends to increase with age and muscle mass tends to decrease. Loss of strength that accompanies immobility, starvation and acute surgical illness may have marked functional consequences. Furthermore, the prevalence of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases increase with age. Thus, the delivery of oxygen to tissues may be impaired in the elderly. Finally, observed differences in metabolic responses of men and women generally reflect differences in body composition. Lean body mass is lower in women than in men; and this difference is thought to account for the net loss of nitrogen after major elective abdominal surgery generally being lower in women than in men.",

Patients with long-bone fractures have a 15–25% increase in metabolic rate, whereas metabolic rates in patients with multiple injuries increases by 50%. These metabolic rates in trauma patients are contrasted with those in postoperative patients, who rarely increase their BMR by more than 10–15% following operation. Studies have shown that uninjured volunteers are able to dispose of exogenous glucose load much more readily than injured patients. Other studies have demonstrated a failure to suppress hepatic glucose production in trauma patients during glucose loading or insulin infusion. Thus, profound insulin resistance occurs in injured patients. Skeletal muscle is the major source of nitrogen that is lost in the urine following extensive injury. Although it is recognized that amino acids are released by muscle in increased quantities following injuries, it has only been recently appreciated that the composition of amino acid reflux does not reflect the composition of muscle protein. The release is skewed towards glutamine and alanine, each of which comprise about one-third of the total amino acids released by skeletal muscle. To support hypermetabolism, stored triglyceride is mobilized at an accelerated rate. Although mobilization and use of free fatty acids are accelerated in injured subjects, if unfed, severely injured patients rapidly deplete their fat and protein stores.",

In such patients, oral intake of food almost invariably results in increased fistula output with associated metabolic disturbances, dehydration, skin breakdown, and death. Several comprehensive reviews have concluded that TPN clearly impacts on the treatment course of the disease in patients with GI fistulas. The following conclusions can be drawn from studies evaluating the use of TPN in patients with enterocutaneous fistula. First, TPN increases spontaneous closure rate of enterocutaneous fistulas but does not markedly decrease the mortality rate in patients with fistulas. Second, if spontaneous closure of the fistula does not occur, patients are better prepared for operative intervention because of the nutritional support they have received. Finally, certain fistulas are associated with a lower rate of spontaneous closure than others and should be treated more aggressively surgically after a defined period of nutritional support (unless closure occurs). 120 Appropriate guidelines for the use of TPN in cancer patients include: As a general rule, the most important factor to consider when making decisions about the use of TPN in patients with cancer is the response of the tumor to antineoplastic therapy. Appropriate guidelines would include the following: Short-term TPN is indicated in severely malnourished patients or in those in whom gastrointestinal or other toxicities preclude adequate enteral intake for seven days or a longer period. TPN is not indicated in well nourished or mildly malnourished patients undergoing therapy or surgery who would be expected to be able to resume adequate nutrition in approximately seven days. Long-term TPN is indicated in patients in whom treatment associated toxicities preclude the use of enteral nutrition and represent the primary impediment to the restoration of performance status. These patients should be expected to be responding to anti-tumor therapy. Long-term TPN is not indicated with rapidly progressive tumor growth which is unresponsive to such therapy.",

The average-sized adult who sustains a major burn rarely may require more than 3500 kcal/day for maintenance.",

The rise in ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to elaborate cortisol which remains elevated for 24–48 hours after operation. The neuroendocrine responses to operation also modify the various mechanisms that regulate salt and water excretion. Alterations in serum osmolarity and tonicity of body fluids secondary to anesthesia and operative stress, stimulate the secretion of aldosterone and ADH. Thus, the ability to excrete a water load after elective surgical procedures is restricted, and weight gain secondary to salt and water retention is usual following an operation. Alterations occur in response to the endocrine pancreas following elective operation. Insulin elaboration is diminished and glucagon concentrations rise. The rise in glucagon and the corresponding fall in insulin are important signals to accelerate hepatic glucose production, and, with other hormones (epinephrine and glucocorticoids), gluconeogenesis is maintained.",

Patients randomized to receive TPN starting on postoperative day 1 were noted to have an increased incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses as well as a tendency towards increased incidence in peritonitis and bowel obstruction. These investigators concluded that routine use of postoperative TPN was not indicated and may, in fact, be harmful following pancreatic resection. In another study, however, perioperative (starting 7 days prior to the planned procedure) TPN for patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrated that this regimen statistically reduced infectious complications compared to patients who did not receive TPN.

The hemostatic response to this is clot formation to stop hemorrhage. Platelet plug formation initiates the hemostatic process along with clotting factors activated by collagen and the basement membrane proteins exposed by the injury. Platelets then degranulate, releasing the contents of their alpha granules and dense granules, most notably platelet derived growth factor and transforming growth factor b. These substances initiate chemotaxis and proliferation of inflammatory cells, beginning the inflammatory response that will ultimately heal the wound.

The major difference is in the healing incisional wound, the healing process progresses in an orderly temporal sequence. In an open wound, the healing events are spatially separated. In the healing wound, a bed of granulation tissue forms over the exposed subcutaneous tissue. Granulation tissue is composed of new capillaries, proliferating fibroblasts, an immature matrix of collagen, proteoglycans, substrate adhesion molecules, and acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Granulation tissue is the cobblestone pink surface of the healthy new tissue in an open wound. The ability of an open wound to form granulation tissue is governed by the blood supply to the tissue and the relative absence of devitalized tissue and bacteria. Epithelialization is therefore enhanced by limiting bacterial growth which presumably interferes via bacterial and phagocytic cell products such as proteases, collagenases, elastases, and other enzymes.",

        "explanation": "Bone marrow suppression, a common consequence of chemotherapy, is detrimental to wound healing. Quantitative and qualitative lymphocyte and monocyte deficiency impairs cellular proliferation in the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Any chemotherapeutic agent that suppresses the bone marrow will impair healing. Glucocorticoids inhibit wound healing based on their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The anti-inflammatory effect of steroids is, in part, the result of inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism by impairing macrophage migration, and by altering neutrophil function. Glucocorticoids also inhibit the synthesis of procollagen by fibroblasts, thus delaying wound contraction. Radiation injury leads to arteriolar fibrosis and impaired oxygen delivery. In addition, there is progressive obliteration of blood vessels in the radiated area over time. Radiation also causes intranuclear and cytoplasmic damage to fibroblasts, and this appears to limit their proliferative potential. Diabetes mellitus is often associated with decreased healing of open wounds and increased susceptibility of infection. Many factors contribute to poor healing in diabetic patients and most of them reflect local wound ischemia. However, healing is not impaired in a normally perfused area in a well-controlled diabetic. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease secondary to atherosclerosis can be a primary cause of impaired healing, and may be also a cofactor with other conditions.",

Macrophages are mononuclear phagocytic cells derived from circulating monocytes or resident tissue macrophages. They complete the process of removing all material not necessary for the ensuing steps of wound healing. Lymphocytes also appear in wounds in small numbers during the inflammatory response. The role of lymphocytes in the wound healing process remains to be clarified, but they are thought to be more related to the chronic inflammatory processes than the initial response to wounding.

Meticulous hemostasis reduces the inflammation of phagocytosis necessary to clear the wound of blood. Atraumatic handling of tissue decreases the load of necrotic or nonviable cells at the wound margin. Deep sutures are best placed only into collagen laden structures that will hold tension, i.e., fascia and dermis. These tissues have a tensile strength to hold sutures under tension. Fat does not contain collagen and will not hold tension. Therefore, fatty tissue should not be sutured as a separate layer. Given that epithelialization of an incision is normally complete within 24–48 hours, there is no reason to protect the incision from water beyond this time period. Allowing the patient to wash or shower one or two days after surgery actually serves useful purpose in debriding the wound.",

If a wound is kept moist with an occlusive dressing, then epithelial migration is optimized. In addition, the pain of an open wound is dramatically reduced under an occlusive dressing. The traditional wet-to-dry dressing if truly left to dry, simply produces desiccation and necrosis of the surface layer of the wound which delays epithelialization. Although wet-to-dry dressings can be effective for debridement of wound exudate, they are generally less desirable than a moist healing environment combined with effective cleaning of the wound (i.e. water irrigation). Any open wound will leak plasma. With more inflammation, the plasma capillary permeability is further increased. This exudate of serum proteins and inflammatory cells serves as a rich culture medium. This, in turn, will continue to cycle bacterial proliferation and lead to further exudate formation. The net result of this cycle is delayed or absent wound healing. In addition, the edema that results from capillary dysfunction, increases the distance for diffusion from oxygen and nutrient sources to their metabolic targets.",

In the absence of large amounts of necrotic tissue, wound debridement does not need to be accomplished surgically. Simple water irrigation either with whirlpool or by water from a hand held shower spray can generate enough power to effectively debride most wounds. Frequent moist dressing changes can accomplish this as well, and in some cases, occlusive absorptive dressings can generate enough tissue proteases to effectively degrade proteins which the absorptive dressings remove. Deeper portions of a wound may accumulate exudate and bacteria. In such cases, water irrigation may be particularly useful. Commonly used agents such as hydrogen peroxide actually may be harmful to normal tissue and are weak oxidants and do a poor job of debriding. Enzymatic debriding agents can be effective when used properly. Most of the newer dressing products have been designed to be more absorptive and achieve moist healing without infection from excess exudate. However, it must be emphasized that as long as moist healing is achieved, there has been no evidence that one product is better than another.",

        "explanation": "The role of antibiotics in wound care is controversial. All open wounds are colonized with bacteria. Only when surrounding tissue is invaded (cellulitis) are systemic antibiotics clearly indicated. Antibiotics may also be useful in other situations such as when granulation tissue has a high bacterial count (> 105 organisms/gram tissue), or in the case of reduced resistance to bacteria such as in a diabetic foot ulcer. The routine use of systemic antibiotics for chronic wounds should be avoided to reduce the development of resistant bacterial strains within the wound. Topical ointments are frequently used and can be useful. The topical vehicle may help keep the wound moist and the bacterial count in the wound may be lowered as the result. However, as with most antibiotics, resistant organisms quickly emerge. Silver sulfadiazine, frequently used for burn care, is also useful for chronic wounds. Its broad spectrum of activity, lack of relevant drug-resistant plasmids in bacteria, and its low cost make it a good choice.",

        "explanation": "Wound contraction is an important event which contrasts healing open wounds and closed incisions. When open wounds contract, the surrounding skin is pulled over the open wound to reduce its size. This can occur much faster than epithelialization. As opposed to other animals, human skin does not have a significant degree of mobility in most sites and specifically on the lower leg, the skin is tightly adherent and less elastic. Therefore, although contraction may account for 90% of reduction of wound size on the perineum, it accounts for, at most, 30–40% of healing of a lower leg ulcer. All healing wounds generate a strong contractile force. When this force is exerted across a joint, it may result in scar contracture which may limit the functional range of motion. At the cellular level, the force which drives wound contraction comes from fibroblasts. Fibroblasts, like muscle cells, contain actin microfilaments. When these filaments increase in number, the cells take a morphologic appearance of myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are seen in an increased number in contracting wounds and are felt to play an active role in the process of wound contraction.",

During the initial phase of wound healing, there is a relative abundance of type III collagen in the wound. With remodeling, the normal adult ratio of 4:1 (type I to type III) collagen is restored. The other important component of the extracellular matrix is the ground substance or proteoglycans. These substances are composed of a protein background with long hydrophilic carbohydrate side chains. The hydrophilic nature of these molecules accounts for much of the water content of scar. Scars never achieve the degree of order advanced by collagen in normal skin or tendons, but they do increase in strength for six months or more, eventually reaching 70% of the strength of unwounded skin.",

In vitro studies have documented an age-dependent decrease in proliferative potential of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Clinically this will account for the formation of finer scars and improved cosmetic appearance in the elderly. Sutures should be left in place longer to allow for the slow regain of tensile strength in the aged. This can also be done without concern for formation of suture marks as slower epithelialization occurs along the sutures.

        "explanation": "The initial step of epithelialization involves epithelial cells from the basal layer of the wound edge flattening and migrating across the wound, completing wound coverage within 24–48 hours in a co-opted surgical wound. Epithelial cells exhibit contact inhibition. That is, they will continue to migrate across an appropriate bed until a single continuous layer is formed. Epithelial cell migration occurs by a process in which the epithelial cells send out pseudopods, attaching to the underlying extracellular matrix by integrin receptors. Bacteria, large amounts of protein exudate from leaky capillaries, and necrotic tissue all compromise this process delaying epithelialization. In the case of open wounds, epithelialization results from migration of epithelial cells from remaining dermal appendages, sweat glands, and hair follicles, if the dermis is not completely destroyed. In a full thickness injury, the entire dermis is destroyed or removed. Epithelialization therefore occurs only at the margins of a wound, at a dermal rate of 1–2 mm/day. Visible scarring occurs only when the injury extends deeper than the superficial dermis. Superficial abrasions and burns usually heal without scar, while deeper abrasions and burns may scar significantly. Whenever the dermis is incised, a scar will form.",

Interestingly, there are no known systemic conditions that lead to enhanced or more rapid wound healing. Overall nutrition as well as adequate vitamins play an important role in wound healing. Vitamin A is involved in the stimulation of fibroplasia, collagen cross-linking, and epithelialization. Although there is no conclusive evidence in humans, vitamin A may be useful clinically for steroid-dependent patients who have problematic wounds or who are undergoing extensive surgical procedures. Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor in hydroxylization of lysine and proline in collagen synthesis and cross-linkage. The utility of vitamin C supplementation in patients who otherwise take in a normal diet has not been established. Vitamin E is applied to wounds and incisions empirically by many patients. The evidence to support this practice is entirely anecdotal. In fact, large doses of vitamin E have been found to inhibit wound healing. Zinc and copper are also important cofactors for many enzyme systems that are important to wound healing. Deficiency states are seen with parenteral nutrition but are rare and readily recognized and treated with supplements. Overall, vitamin and mineral deficiency states are extremely rare in the absence of parenteral nutrition or other extreme dietary restrictions.

        ],
        "explanation": "True keloids are uncommon and occur predominantly in dark skinned people with a genetic predisposition for keloid formation. In most cases, the gene appears to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant pattern. The primary difference between a keloid and a hypertrophic scar is that a keloid extends beyond the boundary of the original tissue injury. It behaves as a tumor and extends into or invades the normal surrounding tissue creating a scar that is larger than the original wound. Histologically, keloids and hypertrophic scars are similar. Both contain an overabundance of collagen. Although the absolute number of fibroblasts is not increased, the production of collagen continually out paces the activity of collagenase, resulting in a scar of ever increasing dimensions. Hypertrophic scars respect the boundaries of the original injury and do not extend into normal unwounded tissue. There is less of a genetic predisposition, but hypertrophic scars also occur more frequently in Orientals and the Black population. They are often seen on the upper torso and across flexor surfaces. Some improvement in a keloid can be obtained with excision followed by intra-lesional steroid injection. However, the resulting scar is unpredictable and potentially worse. Reexcision and closure should, however, be considered for hypertrophic scars, if the condition of closure can be improved. This is especially pertinent for wounds that originally healed by secondary intention or that are complicated by infection. Keloids typically develop several months after the injury and rarely, if ever, subside. Hypertrophic scars usually develop within the first month after wounding and often subside gradually.",

Vasodilatation increases local blood flow to the wounded area, supplying the cells and substrate necessary for further wound repair. The vascular endothelial cells also deform, increasing vascular permeability. The vasodilatation and increased endothelial permeability is mediated by histamine, PGE2, and prostacyclin as well as growth factor VEGF (vascular endothelial cell growth factor).

This deficiency has been described in patients with pulmonary embolism, mesenteric venous thrombosis, lower extremity venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, and dialysis fistula failure. Antithrombin III is a serine protease inhibitor of thrombin and factors Xa, IXa and XIa. Because one of the main actions of heparin is to potentiate the anticoagulant effects of antithrombin III, a patient with this deficiency usually presents with thrombosis while on heparin or exhibits the inability to become adequately anticoagulated with heparin. This deficiency may be either congenital (1n2000–5000 births) or acquired. Acquired defects occur with inadequate production, as in liver disease, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, disseminated intervascular coagulation, malnutrition, or increased protein catabolism. Thrombotic episodes are related to predisposing events such as operations, childbirth, and infections. Once the diagnosis of antithrombin III deficiency is established, fresh frozen plasma should be administered followed by long-term treatment with Coumadin. 151 Mini-dose heparin has been shown to be useful in the prophylaxis of postoperative venous thrombosis. Mechanism(s) by which low-dose heparin is/are thought to protect against venous thrombosis include: Low-dose heparin is thought to protect against venous thrombosis through three different mechanisms. First, antithrombin III activity with its inhibition of activated Factor X is enhanced by only trace amounts of heparin; second, there is a decrease in thrombin availability that prevents its activation and thus its fibrin-stabilizing effect; and third, small doses of heparin may inhibit the second wave of platelet aggregation and subsequent platelet release reaction. The standard doses of heparin administered (5000 units bid) does not affect aPTT.",

        "explanation": "Coagulation tests include prothrombin time (PT), which measures the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of fibrinogen production and is the most common method for measuring a level of oral anticoagulant therapy. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) identifies the abnormalities of the contact and intrinsic phases of coagulation. Values of aPTT have variably been shown to correlate with heparin dosages and serum heparin levels and are therefore most commonly used in monitoring heparin therapy. It is of no value in long-term management of patients on oral Warfarin therapy. Thrombin clotting time (TCT) is the measure of the time it takes for exogenously administered thrombin to turn plasma fibrinogen into fibrin clot. It is extremely sensitive to levels of heparin and is an excellent measure of measuring the level of heparin-induced anticoagulation. The beauty of the TCT is that it is not specific for any disease condition; thus it may be used to differentiate factor deficiencies from the presence of heparin, or to separate lupus anticoagulant from abnormalities in fibrinogen levels. The whole blood activated clotting time (ACT) is a measurement of the ability of whole blood to clot, and as such, is an available technique for monitoring heparin levels intraoperatively. The ACT responds in a linear fashion to increasing heparin dosage and correlates well with the observed clinical anticoagulation. Adequate anticoagulation for extracorporeal circulation is defined as an ACT of 480 seconds or more while for peripheral vascular applications, values of 250 seconds or greater are considered appropriate.",

If progress is made, further fibrinolytic therapy is given at 1000 to 2000 units per minute for a 6–12 hour period or until clot lysis has occurred. Using this technique, mean infusion time in a recent study was found to be 18 hours and the incidence of bleeding complications was significantly lessened. Selective intraarterial infusion of urokinase was associated with complete clot resolution in 77% of native arterial occlusions versus only 41% with arterial graft occlusion. After thrombolytic therapy has reopened an occluded vessel or graft, radiologic or surgical correction of the lesion responsible for the thrombosis in the first place must be addressed for any hope of long-term success. The use of intraoperative thrombolytic therapy is advocated in those situations where complete clot resolution cannot be accomplished (such as following balloon embolectomy for acute arterial occlusion) or when distal vasculative is occluded and precludes appropriate inflow patency.",

Clinical manifestations include epistaxis, gingival bleeding, menorrhagia, rare joint or muscle bleeding, and subcutaneous bleeding. Spontaneous bleeding is not as common as in classic Hemophilia A. The syndrome is transmitted as both autosomal dominant (heterozygous) and autosomal recessive disease (homozygous) traits. Therefore there is no sex predilection. Screening laboratory tests include a prolonged aPTT with a normal prothrombin time. In addition, because of the importance of this factor in platelet adhesion, patients display a prolonged bleeding time and have decreased level of factor VIII activity, decreased immunoreactive levels of Von Willebrand’s antigen, and abnormal platelet aggregation responses to ristocetin.

The clinical manifestations revolve around the antigen on the red blood cell stroma and the antibody in the patient’s serum, and include production of bradykinin, compliment activation, release of vasoactive agents from platelets, and initiation of systemic clotting. Chills and fevers, chest pain and lumbar pain, tachycardia and hypotension in the conscious patient, and often diffuse bleeding in the anesthetized, unconscious patient constitute this syndrome. Although reaction occurs immediately, death related to the syndrome is uncommon, unless associated with a transfusion of more than 100 ml of blood. Death usually occurs from acute renal failure or hemorrhage due to DIC. Nonhemolytic reactions occur with the frequency of 1 to 2% of all transfusions and consist primarily of chills and fevers during the transfusion or in the first 2 to 3 hours after the transfusion is complete. Mechanism of these reactions includes the presence of antibodies to white blood cell antigens in the transfused blood, especially in the multitransfused or multiparous patient. Massive transfusion complications relate to the rate and volume of blood transfused. The most common complication is dilutional thrombocytopenia. Factor deficiency of the labile factors V and VIII rarely is of sufficient magnitude to result in problems with hemostasis. For hypocalcemia to occur with massive transfusion, citrated blood must be administered, one unit every five minutes. Routine empiric calcium supplementation is unnecessary during most massive transfusion episodes. Conversely, hypothermia is clearly a problem, especially when associated with massive transfusion during complex intraoperative procedures such as thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection.",

        "explanation": "Tests of platelet function include peripheral platelet counts, bleeding times, and platelet aggregation. Usually, a platelet count of 50,000/mL or more ensures adequate hemostasis, whereas counts less than 10,000/mL are dangerous and may lead to spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding time performed by observing the clotting of blood induced with a small needle stick, assesses the ability of platelets to perform hemostatic plugs and are usually shorter than eight minutes. A bleeding time between 8 and 15 minutes most often reflects a low plasma level of Von Willebrand’s Factor or the use of antiplatelet drugs. A bleeding time greater than 15 minutes is clearly prolonged and indicates severe platelet functional impairment. Platelet aggregation studies involve the use of a number of different agonists. Although a relatively straightforward technique, platelet aggregation is not available in most laboratories, probably because of the observer-dependent nature of the test. 166 As thrombin generation proceeds, the body has natural anticoagulant systems opposing further thrombus formation. Natural anticoagulants include: Just as thrombin generation is the key to coagulation, antithrombin III is the most central anticoagulant proteins. This glycoprotein binds to thrombin, preventing its removal of fibrinoprotein A and B from fibrinogen, prevents the activation of factor V and VIII and the activation and aggregation of platelets. The second line of defense is the activated protein C, which inactivates factors Va and VIIIa. This inactivation reduces the ability of the prothrombinase complex to accelerate the rate of thrombin formation. A third natural anticoagulant is heparin cofactor II. Its concentration in plasma is estimated to be some four-fold lower than antithrombin III, and its action is primarily implicated in the regulation of thrombin formation in extravascular tissues. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is a natural catalyst for the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, the main fibrinolytic enzyme in the body. Therefore, TPA is part of the fibrinolytic system rather than a natural anticoagulant.",

        "explanation": "The most common infectious diseases transmitted during blood transfusions include viral hepatitis, CMV, and HIV infection. Post-transfusion hepatitis in 90% of cases consists of non-A, non-B hepatitis known as hepatitis C. All blood products except for immune serum globulin and albumin can carry and transmit this form of hepatitis. Because heat treatment eliminates the risk of viral transmission, products from pooled plasma that are heat treated such as albumin are not at risk for HIV or hepatitis transmission. CMV transmission exists in three forms—primary, reinfection, and reactivation. Primary exposure results in an IgM response to the virus. Reactivation is most commonly related to pregnancy, transplantation, and immunosuppression, and is the most important cause of post-transfusion disease accompanying immunosuppression of patients. Although the risk of the public concern for transmission of HIV disease associated with blood transfusions has significantly outweighed other infectious disease transmission, the risks of HIV transmission is markedly less than that of hepatitis. 168 There are a number of hypercoaguable states which can be associated with arterial or venous thrombosis and embolic phenomenon. These include: A number of hypercoaguable states are present. These include heparin-associated thrombocytopenia in which a heparin-dependent platelet antibody causes aggregation of platelets when the patient is exposed to heparin. Activation of platelets in this setting results in thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and embolic episodes. Antithrombin III deficiency accounts for about 2% of venous thrombotic events and has been described in pulmonary embolism, mesenteric venous thrombosis, lower extremity venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, and dialysis fistula failure. Von Willebrand’s disease is a hereditary complex coagulation factor deficiency which is manifested by a reduction of factor VIII activity, and the Von Willebrand factor which is an adhesive protein that mediates platelet adhesion to collagen. Severe vitamin C deficiency results in a disorder in soft tissue increasing vascular permeability and fragility resulting in the potential for bleeding disorders.",

In addition to being important triggers for the induction of other cytokines important inflammatory network, TNFa and IL-1 appear to be key mediators in promoting the adherence of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. IL-1 is a complex, multifunctional molecule that shares many overlapping biological properties with TNFa. In addition, both IL-1 and TNFa potentiate the effects of one another. The most important function of IL-6 appears to be the regulation of the hepatic acute phase response. Following injury, a number of physiologic changes develop within several hours. IL-6 is one of the primary stimuli for the production of acute phase proteins from the liver. Endotoxin, IL-1, TNFa and PDGF are capable of causing significant induction of IL-6 synthesis. Over the last decade, at least 12 different C-X-C chemokines have been identified. These include IL-8, one of the most potent mediators of chemotaxis known. TNFa and IL-1 are key molecules for the induction of IL-8, which in turn is important for the induction of neutrophil recruitment and activation. Similar properties are apparent for other members of this chemokine family. Platelet activation and degranulation occur during coagulation following injury, leading to the deposition of a number of cytokines into the provisional matrix. These cytokines include transforming growth factor-a, (TGFa), transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). These cytokines are either important growth factors or chemotaxis for leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes which are key components in the process of tissue repair. Thus, coagulation and platelet activation provide the initial foundation for subsequent cellular recruitment.",

TGF-b also induces both the infiltrating cells and resident cells to produce more TGF-b. This auto-induction amplifies its biological effects at the site of injury and may play an important role in the development of chronic fibrosis in a variety of pathologic states. TGF-b enhances collagen synthesis as well. Lastly, TGF-b may function as a mitogen or growth inhibitor for a wide variety of cell types, including selected cell types of mesenchymal origin. Whether TGF-b stimulates or inhibits proliferation depends on the presence of other growth factors, the concentration of TGF-b, and the cell density. Thus, at low doses, TGF-b stimulates the proliferation of densely plated human marrow fibroblasts, but is inhibitory at high concentrations.",

        "explanation": "IL-1 appears to be important in the process of normal wound repair. IL-1 has been shown to stimulate skin fibroblast and keratinocyte growth, as well as fibroblast collagen synthesis and keratinocyte chemotaxis. IL-1 also promotes increased transcription of the matrix degradative enzymes collagenase and stromelysin. These are important and potent tissue degrading proteinases. Other studies have demonstrated that IL-1 inhibits fibroblast growth and matrix synthesis, and stimulates collagenase production. These actions are at least partly due to the ability of IL-1 to upregulate prostaglandin E2 production which results in the down regulation of matrix synthesis. IL-1 has both promoting and inhibiting effects on fibroblast collagen synthesis, therefore, the overall activity in this area is somewhat unclear in comparison to other well-defined fibroblast growth-promoting cytokines. TNFa inhibits fibroblast collagen synthesis, however it also has potent mitogenic effects. The mitogenic response correlates well with an increased stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation. Both IL-1 and TNFa have similar effects upon bone. Both stimulate cartilage resorption, the release of proteoglycans from cartilage by limited proteolytic degradation, and both inhibit proteoglycan synthesis. Recent studies have also demonstrated that TNFa inhibits fracture healing in experimental animals. This is due to the inhibition of cartilage formation and new bone synthesis, and the inhibition of mesenchymal cell differentiation into chondroblasts. The family of epithelial growth factor (EGF)-like molecules induce mitogenesis and play a role in wound healing. In human clinical trials, EGF has been demonstrated to accelerate epidermal regeneration in cutaneous wounds. In vitro data show that recombinant EGF enhances keratinocyte migration. EGF is also a potent chemoattractant for granulation tissue fibroblasts.",

Although TNF a, IL-1 and LPS were initially reported to have direct neutrophil chemotactic activity, recent studies have demonstrated that these molecules are not directly chemotactic for neutrophils. This finding suggests that cytokine networks may be operative in vivo and depend on the initial expression of early response cytokines. This initial interaction is followed by the generation of more distal inflammatory mediators that directly influence neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. There is a particularly important group of novel chemotactic cytokines which share significant homology with the presence of four conserved cysteine amino acid residues. These cytokines in their monomeric forms are all less than 10 kD, are characteristically basic heparin-binding proteins, have specific neutrophil chemotactic activity and display four highly conserved cysteine amino acid residues, with the first two cysteines separated by one non-conserved amino acid residue. Because of their chemotactic properties and the presence of C-X-C cysteine motif, these have been designated the C-X-C chemokine family. Twelve different chemokines have been identified in the last decade. These include IL-8, epithelial neutrophil activating protein (ENA-78), and others.

Overall, IL-1 alone probably has weaker effects than TNFa with respect to the induction of shock; its role is likely to be important with respect to its marked potentiating abilities as it relates to TNFa. IL-1 expression is regulated by a host of factors including IL-2, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), TNFa, all of the interferons, and IL-1 itself. Other endogenous stimuli for IL-1 production include antigen-antibody complex, the Fc region of IgG, and C5a; other nonspecific exogenous stimuli include silica particles and UV irradiation. One of the key proinflammatory features of IL-1-induced inflammation is the stimulation of arachadonic acid metabolism. IL-1 stimulates the release of pituitary stress hormones and increases the synthesis of collagenases, resulting in the destruction of cartilage, bone and other collagen-rich structures. IL-1 stimulates prostaglandin production. One of the most important properties of IL-1 involves its interaction with the vascular endothelium. This includes the adherence of neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes to the vascular endothelium via interaction between adhesion molecules on leukocytes and adhesion-receptor complex on the endothelial cells. By inducing the expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells, IL-1 provides a key step in the extravasation of leukocytes to sites of local inflammation and injury.",

C1 is not an anaphylatoxin as it is the initial complement component which binds to antigen-antibody complex to initiate classical pathway activation. C5a acts principally to alter the behavioral characteristics of leukocytes. Effects include enhanced adherence, enhanced chemotactic activity, release of proteinases, and production of toxic metabolites of oxygen. C3, on the other hand, plays a key role in bacterial opsonization, resulting in enhanced phagocytosis of invading microorganisms. The alternative and classical complement pathways converge at the C5 level proximal to generating the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) (Figure 6-3).",

        "explanation": "The neutrophil is a migratory phagocytic cell that defends the host against bacteria and eliminates necrotic tissue. The neutrophil matures in the bone marrow and is released into the circulation as a fully differentiated cell. It is loaded with granules containing a variety of proteinases, hydrolases, antimicrobial agents and cationic proteins. The cell phagocytoses material and the granules fuse with the phagocytic vacuoles to degrade the foreign material. When the cells are challenged with a large amount of material, the granule contents may be released into the extracellular space where damage to surrounding tissue occurs. The neutrophil normally circulates in the human bloodstream for 7 to 10 hours. Thereafter, neutrophils are thought to exist for 1 to 2 days in the tissues before being cleared from the system. Granule constituents are formed during differentiation and replenishment of spent granules does not occur once the cells are in the circulation. Hence, the neutrophil is a fully differentiated end-cell poised to respond rapidly to stimuli, but it is rapidly spent in the process. Neutrophils have a NADPH-oxidase enzyme system on the plasma membrane which can be activated to produce toxic oxygen species including the superoxide anion (02–). Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have a defective NADPH-oxidase system in their neutrophils, and are thus unable to generate 02–. Although neutrophils from patients with CGD are able to phagocytose bacteria, they are unable to kill the intracellular microbes and chronic, unresolved infections result.",

        "explanation": "The alternative pathway differs from the classic pathway in that the first steps involving C1, C4 and C2 are bypassed. (See Figure 6-3 previously reproduced.) This pathway can be directly activated by agents other than antigen–antibody complex (e.g., complex polysaccharides like endotoxin and zymosan). Other serum protein factors (e.g., factors B and D) are involved in the activation sequence. Ammonia can attack the thiol-ester, producing amidated C3 and activate the alternative pathway. This leads to membrane attack complex formation (C5b-9) and activation of a number of phagocytic cell functions including toxic oxidant production. This phenomenon may have relevance to several in vivo disease states. In animal models of renal failure, elevated levels of renal vein NH3 have been correlated with impaired renal function and the presence of complement components at the sites of renal injury. 182 Platelet activating factor is: Like the eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor (PAF) is not stored in cells but is rapidly produced during inflammation. PAF exerts a variety of biologic effects that are platelet-independent. The synthesis of PAF is initiated by the activation of phospholipase A2. Activation of phospholipase A2 releases arachidonic acid in addition to lyso-PAF. Hence, PAF synthesis and eicosanoid production are coordinately regulated. PAF is synthesized on activation of a variety of inflammatory cells including platelets, neutrophils, basophils, mast cells, mononuclear phagocytes, eosinophils and vascular endothelium. PAF is a stimulatory agonist for many inflammatory cells, as well as for smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelium and others. PAF enhances the ability of neutrophils to respond to challenge with N-formylpeptides and LTB4. There is considerable overlap and redundancy in the effects produced by PAF and eicosanoids.",

They have potent effects on vascular and bronchial smooth muscle including vasodilatation, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation and bronchoconstriction. In addition, they directly regulate vascular permeability. LTB4 is a potent, neutrophil chemoattractant whereas lipoxin A4 inhibits other chemoattractants. It appears that eicosanoids are important regulators of the endogenous inflammatory response. The rapid destruction of eicosanoids in the circulation limits their role primarily to that of mediators of local inflammatory changes. The local effects can be substantial. In general, the eicosanoids are rapidly metabolized or are so chemically unstable that they primarily exert their effects near the site of synthesis. Arachidonic acid does not exist in cells but is esterified to membrane phospholipids. Thus, the first step in the production of eicosanoids is phospholipase action, which liberates arachidonic acid.

They are less effective as bactericidal cells than neutrophils, but play a major role in defense against parasites. Eosinophils are primary effectors in allergic reactions by virtue of IgE receptors (which are not found on neutrophils). Basophils are fully differentiated cells released into the circulation from bone marrow. Basophils are the major, if not sole, source of histamine in the blood. Histamine is a vasoactive amine and the major mediator of the IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity response. Histamine release from basophils is induced by complement products as well as by IgE receptors. Mast cells are formed from bone marrow precursors that differentiate and proliferate in connective tissue. Mast cell granules contain histamine and proteoglycans. They represent the major source of histamine in most tissues except the stomach and central nervous system. The monocyte–macrophage system consists of phagocytic cells scattered throughout the body. During acute inflammation, monocytes respond to chemoattractants released and are recruited to the site of inflammation. Mononuclear phagocytes respond to inflammatory stimuli by releasing M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, and TNF, in addition to a variety of growth factors. These factors increase the production of mononuclear phagocytes and several of these factors enhance the ability of effector cells to respond to chemotactic stimuli released at the site of injury. Thus, the mononuclear phagocytes are important in initiating and augmenting the cycle of events that result in recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells at sites of inflammation.",

This is the result of angiotensin-converting enzyme on the cell surface as well as the production of both endothelia (a potent vasoconstrictor) and nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator). Both play important physiologic roles in determining the distribution of blood flow. In addition, recent evidence suggests that NO may have direct effects upon the expression of a variety of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Under unusual circumstances, endothelial cells can exhibit macrophage-like properties in that they can act as antigen-presenting cells and also phagocytose particles.

        "explanation": "Humoral defenses consist of antibody (immunoglobulin; Ig) and complement. All Ig classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD) and IgG subclasses are composed of one type (M, G, A, E, D) of heavy and one type (K and g ) of light protein chains that consist of several domains both structurally and functionally. Each Ig molecule contains one or more units that consist of two heavy and two light chains linked by disulfide bonds. The amino terminus of both heavy and light chains contain several hypervariable regions that fold in three dimensions to produce the antigen-binding site. The carboxyl terminus of the heavy chains contain regions that activate complement and bind Fc receptors, by which direct adherence to polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages take place after antigen binding occurs. Initially, antibody of the IgM class is produced in response to an antigenic stimulus. A second exposure to the same antigen, or a cross-reactive antigen, leads to the so-called second set response, in which antibody of the IgG class with two binding sites is produced more rapidly and in larger quantity compared to the initial IgM primary response. Immunoglobulin of the IgA class is secreted by gut-associated lymphoid tissue and is combined with secretory components of protein to form a dimer termed secretory IgA. This antibody acts at a variety of epithelial sites to prevent microbial adherence and invasion. IgD and IgE exist in smaller amounts in the circulation and do not appear to play a major role as host defense components. 191 Increasing evidence has implicated gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS endotoxin) as the portion of the gram-negative bacterial cell membrane responsible for many, if not all the toxic effects that occur during gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The following statement(s) is/are true concerning LPS and the host response. The LPS molecule exerts diverse effects on the mammalian host. Immunologic responses to LPS include nonspecific polyclonal B-cell proliferation, macrophage activation and cytokine secretion, tolerance to subsequent LPS or bacterial challenge, and production of antibody directed against various portions of the LPS molecule after repeated challenge. Physiologic responses similar to those seen during gram-negative bacterial sepsis occur during LPS administration alone and include hypotension, hypoxemia, acidosis, bacterial translocation across the gut, complement and coagulation cascade activation, white blood cell and platelet margination, and death. Indirect effects result from LPS-triggering of host macrophages. Activated macrophages secrete a wide array of cytokines that include TNF-a, IL-1a, and IL-1b, IL-6 and interferon-a (IFNa). Excessive secretion of cytokines produce substantial systemic effects in the mammalian host. TNFa and IL-1b appear to be the primary mediators within the local host milieu, exerting deleterious effects on the host only after large amounts are secreted and reach the systemic circulation.",

        "explanation": "The composition of the gut microflora is established in neonates after ingestion of microbes that are acquired during contamination from the birth canal and during initial feeding, and remain relatively constant thereafter. Although this flora acts to promote development of the immune system, the specific interactions that produce this effect have not been fully elucidated. The microflora also contributes to physical and chemical barriers at the mucus membrane level, in that many autochthonous microbes possess adhesion proteins by which they can bind to certain areas of the mucosal cell or to specific types of bacteria, occupying potential binding sites for pathogenic organisms and producing a substantial physical mucobacterial layer. The oropharynx contains a number of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, however, these microbial inhabitants do not usually pass into the intestine, because the stomach itself represents a significant barrier to invading microorganisms by virtue of its low pH, which kills most microbes. The upper small intestine contains few organisms, mainly gram-positive aerobes and lactobacilli. Conversely, the lower small intestine contains a large number of aerobes and anaerobic forms, especially in patients in whom the ileocecal valve allows free backwash of cecal contents into the terminal ileum. Within the colon, a wide diversity and a large number of facultative and strict anaerobic isolates are present. Only a small number of aerobes are present, these microbes being outnumbered 100–300 to 1 by anaerobes. 193 The use of antibiotics can be based on either the clinical course of a patient without the benefit of well-defined microbiologic data (empiric therapy), or targeted at specific identified pathogens once sensitivity reports are available (directed therapy). The following statement(s) is/are true concerning these therapies. The use of empiric therapy without the benefit of well-defined microbiologic data is appropriate when there is sufficient clinical evidence to support the diagnosis such that it would be imprudent to withhold antimicrobial therapy. In this setting, however, a diligent search for the septic focus source should be undertaken and continued (cultures, radiographic procedures, etc.), and initial limits should be placed in the course of empiric therapy with continued reevaluation based on the clinical course of the patient. The choice of antibiotic agents should be based on the clinical situation and known activity patterns within the given institution. Single broad-spectrum agents, although suffering slightly from a lack of individual pathogen specificity, are useful in this setting in that they provide a broad coverage against several groups of pathogens and may avoid some of the toxic effects with specific combined modality regimens. Similarly, for directed therapy, single-agent therapy has been demonstrated to be equivalent to combined therapy and should be chosen in an attempt to select agents with appropriate sensitivities which retain suitable clinical efficacy but exhibit minimal toxicity. After review of cultural reports, many patients have demonstrated polymicrobial infection. Because experimental clinical evidence supports the concept of aerobic-anaerobic synergy, therapy should be directed against all potential components of the infection if the body site is such that these microorganisms may be present. 194 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning newer detection methods of systemic infection. Although the classic detection of infection based on clinical signs of infection and bacterial culture remain the most common clinical tools, increasing reliance has been placed on assays that do not employ cultural data. Specifically, the antibody and cytokine host responses are being intensely examined and extremely sensitive amplified assays that rely on antigen, antibody or microbial DNA detection are employed in the clinical setting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a rapid, antigen-based, immunologic assay that can be used for both antigen and antibody detection, for determination of antibody titer, as well as for screening for monoclonal antibody production. Transblot techniques are being used increasingly in the clinical setting. These include southern, northern, and western immunotransblot techniques used to detect DNA, RNA, or proteins, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is being used in some centers as a sensitive assay to detect small amounts of microbial DNA. This technique involves extraction of the DNA from the test sample with in vitro amplification through repeated nucleic acid denaturing and polymerization so that the gene copy number increases exponentially. This marked amplification of the gene copy number results in extremely sensitive tests which can detect infection at its early stages. Clinically, these detection methods are being used to detect a wide variety of infectious agents including CMV and HIV. Furthermore, preliminary investigations into possible detection of fungal pathogens are underway.",

        "explanation": "Macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and other cells secrete a large number of different compounds, termed cytokines, that are most probably evolved for the purpose of local intercellular and intracellular signaling. Cytokines frequently are secreted after initial lymphocyte or macrophage activation, and may act on the secreting cell itself (autocrine activation) or on other cells within the same local environment (paracrine activation) to cause increased secretion of the same cytokine or other cytokines, respectively. Some cytokines are produced by several cell types, and most produce a wide array of effects. The duality of the effects of the cytokine component of host defenses, exerting both salutatory and deleterious effects on the host, has become increasingly evident. 196 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning cellular defense mechanisms. A wide variety of cell types serve to provide host defense at several levels. Macrophages act as the initial antigen processing cell that serves to present antigen to help T cells, thus initiating the immune response. Macrophages, however, are pluripotent cells that, in the process of engulfing and processing antigen, may become activated. Activated macrophages secrete a variety of cytokines. Macrophages also act as phagocytic cells in the tissues and within the bloodstream, and because of their resident nature in many tissues, also represent the first line of host defenses in many areas of the body, even before activation. PMNS are present within the bloodstream, but only in small numbers within the tissue, and enter an area of infection through diapedesis after chemotactic stimuli are excluded by macrophages, bacterial breakdown products, and complement activation. 197 A diabetic develops a severe perineal infection with skin necrosis, subcutaneous crepitance, and drainage of a thin, watery, grayish and foul-smelling fluid. Management should consist of: The presence of severe perineal infection (referred to as Fournier gangrene when this process involves the perineum and scrotum in males) is associated with a continued high mortality despite aggressive and appropriate therapy. The clinical description provided would suggest an underlying soft tissue necrosis. In a stable patient radiologic studies including a CT scan to define the extent of the disease and the presence of pelvic infection is indicated. Gram stain will likely show evidence of polymicrobial organisms but the presence of Clostridia marked by gram-positive rods would suggest involvement with this organism. Prompt, aggressive and extensive debridement to remove all devitalized and affected tissue and the addition of broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic monitoring, and nutritional support would appear to afford the patient the best chance of survival. The clearest guidelines to determine the limits of resection involve removal of clearly infected, necrotic tissue so that margins several centimeters into grossly normal, healthy tissue are achieved. Because the entire perineal region and buttocks are frequently involved in these patients, performance of a fecal stream diversion by means of a colostomy often provides improved wound care and patient management, although it is not invariably a positive outcome.",

        "explanation": "Intravenous administration of an antibiotic is clearly indicated for patients undergoing clean contaminated operations. These antibiotics should be administered prior to surgery to obtain adequate tissue levels at the time of potential contamination. However, there has been no added benefit demonstrated for the postoperative use of antibiotics with regard to prophylaxis. The choice of antibiotic is a complex issue which remains unresolved largely because both superficial and deep wound infections can occur as a result of either or both skin (superficial wound) flora (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) and body site (deep wound) infection. For this reason, the administration of agents which possess activity directed against these expected agents is reasonable. Although administration of a first-generation cephalosporin is acceptable, second-generation cephalosporins or extended-spectrum penicillins with gram-positive and gram-negative activity and biliary tract excretion may be more suitable for patients undergoing gastrointestinal or biliary tract procedures. Similarly, the use of agents with additional anaerobic activity for patients undergoing gastrointestinal procedures involving the small bowel or colon should be considered. The administration of broad-spectrum agents such as third-generation cephalosporins for prophylaxis does not seem to provide additional benefit in comparison to the above-mentioned type antibiotics and may foster the development of resistant organisms within a given institution or superinfection within a given patient. There is evidence that in some cases the topical use of antimicrobial agents is equivalent to the administration of intravenous antimicrobial agent antibiotics. 199 If a necrotizing soft tissue infection is considered, therapy mandates: Identification of a necrotizing, soft tissue infection mandates immediate operative intervention with aggressive resection of all involved tissues and empiric administration of antibiotics active against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. In most cases, this involves the use of several antimicrobial antibiotics in combination. Because of concern in all cases for the presence of Clostridia infection, high doses of aqueous penicillin G are administered. Gram-positive organisms are treated with vancomycin or a semisynthetic penicillin and gram-negative organisms are treated with an aminoglycoside or a monobactam. Anaerobic coverage is typically achieved by use of metronidazole of clindamycin. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is controversial and unfortunately due to the rarity of the disease, prospective randomized data is not available so that the literature remains without controlled trials demonstrating any additional benefits derived from hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",

        "explanation": "Wounds are classified under three classes according to the likelihood of bacterial contamination: 1) clean (no viscus is entered; e.g., herniorrhaphy); 2) clean-contaminated (minimal contamination; e.g., elective colon resection with adequate mechanical and antibiotic bowel preparation, and 3) contaminated (heavily contaminated surgery; e.g., resection of unprepared, obstructed bowel with gross spillage of intestinal contents or stool, drainage of abscesses, debridement of traumatic neglected wounds). Antibiotic prophylaxis generally should be administered for class 2 and 3 types of wounds, but patients undergoing clean surgery do not always require antimicrobial antibiotic prophylaxis. An exception to this tenet involves cases in which a prosthetic material may be used (artificial joint, heart valve, tissue patch). 201 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning HIV infection. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a syndrome caused by the human retrovirus (HIV-1) that infects T lymphocytes and causes severe immunosuppression. Individuals who become infected with HIV are prone to a variety of infections and different types of malignancy. A spectrum exists in which patients regress from asymptomatic infection, to development of AIDS-related complex (ARC) of diseases to AIDS itself. Common infections occurring in patients with AIDS are Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; CMV pneumonitis; gastritis, hepatitis and meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans; and pneumonia and disseminated infection due to atypical mycobacteria. Predisposition to these infections is due, in part, to the lymphotrophic nature of HIV, which markedly reduces the number of helper T cells as well as the absolute number of T cells. HIV detection typically consists of initial ELISA screening, but this test has about a 1–3% false-positive rate, thus mandating all positive tests be confirmed by the western immunoblot analysis. Treatment of ARC and AIDS consists of aggressive antiinfective therapy once a specific infection occurs and the use of AZT. AZT has been shown to prolong survival when administered early in the course of disease and is considered routine therapy. 202 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning initial microbiologic diagnostic techniques. Because most surgical infections are polymicrobial, specimens should be cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as fungi. Although aerobic and aerotolerant microorganisms often do not require special transport media, a delay in specimen processing may markedly reduce the yield, and anaerobic transport media have been demonstrated to markedly increase the cultural yield of this type of organism. The initial piece of information gained concerning potential infection may come from simple staining of a specimen. Gram stain, which will identify the staining characteristics of the organisms, as well as their number should be performed on all specimens. Potassium hydroxide is useful in that it will lyse bacteria and other cellular elements within a preparation and allow observation of yeast or mycelial elements. Initial culture results may solely indicate that microorganisms are growing and full characterization may take two to three days. Once a specific microorganism is identified, a sample is inoculated during the log phase into broth containing varying amounts of an antibiotic. After an 18-to 24-hour period, the tube or well that exhibits no visible growth is then noted, and the reciprocal of this dilution is termed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). This value may be compared to either measured or known achievable serum levels for a particular antibiotic. In general, antimicrobial agents that achieve in excess of a 4-to 8-fold increase over MIC during the peak serum level have been demonstrated to be clinically efficacious.",

          "A",
          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "Complement activation can occur through either classic or alternate (properdin) pathways, both of which eventuate in deposition of terminal complement pathway components on the antigenic cell surface. The classic pathway of complement activation usually begins with immunoglobulin G-binding which has also bound the antigen. The alternate pathway activation occurs in response to activation of direct binding of the antigen or directly through contact with fungal and bacterial cell wall compounds such as zymosan and gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS endotoxin). Several complement components represent important host defenses acting to recruit or augment cellular host defenses or to directly inactivate invading microbes through lytic activity. The production of complement component fractions C3a and C5a during activation of this cascade serve primarily to markedly increase vascular permeability, and C5a functions as a PMN and macrophage chemoattractant. This process leads to the recruitment of additional humoral and cellular defenses to the specific area of infection. Excessive complement activation can produce deleterious effects in some instances. Complement activation causes enhanced PMN adhesion, margination, and release of lysosomal enzymes that can directly damage certain target tissues, such as the lung. 204 A 55-year-old renal transplant patient has been hospitalized in a Surgical Intensive Care Unit, receiving a prolonged course of antibiotics following an attack of acute cholecystitis. The following statement(s) is/are true concerning his management. Infections due to fungal pathogens have become increasingly common during the past decade, frequently occurring in patients undergoing prolonged hospitalization in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and in immunocompromised individuals. Prophylaxis with oral antifungal agents (nystatin) is warranted, especially during periods of maximal immunosuppression in transplant patients, in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, or during some cases of prolonged antibacterial microbial therapy. In general, local, apparently noninvasive Candida infections involving the integument and mucus membranes are treated with oral decontamination and topical antifungal therapy using topical agents such as nystatin. Candida urinary tract infections can be treated with either an oral antifungal agent or with topical amphotericin B as a continuous bladder irrigation. Several studies have demonstrated that those patients with three positive sites of Candida infection, or with peritoneal or blood cultures positive for Candida exhibit higher survival rates when amphotericin B therapy is instituted earlier in the course of infection. The presence of retinal changes compatible with Candida retinitis or Candida present within the peritoneal cavity are considered indications for a limited course of amphotericin B therapy (300% to 500 mg). Patients receiving exogenous immunosuppressive agents should undergo a marked dose reduction, and some agents should be discontinued until evidence of infection is absolutely controlled or is eradicated.",

        "explanation": "Stimulation of the immune system occurs after a variety of antigen-presenting cells (B lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells) act to engulf, process, and present antigen to T lymphocytes of helper lineage. These T lymphocytes, in turn, act to stimulate B lymphocytes to become mature plasmacytes (through secretion of cytokines such as interleukin 4 and 6) dedicated to the production of antibody directed against the specific antigen. An antigen may be defined as any substance that stimulates the host immune response; that is, that the host immune system recognizes is foreign. Thus, an antigen may be an invading microorganism, an inert particle, or any type of chemical compound that triggers the host immune system. Although some antigens are able to directly stimulate B lymphocytes in and of themselves to produce antibody (many polysaccharides), most antigens require coordinated efforts of the various cellular components of the immune system. 206 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning viral infections. Solid organ transplant patients are prone to develop viral infection by virtue of exogenous immunosuppression. The most common post-transplantation viral infections are those caused by herpes viruses (CMV, herpes simplex virus [HSV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and Varicella-Zoster virus [VZV]). All are most common during periods of maximal host immunosuppression that occur immediately post-transplantation and during periods of allograft rejection. CMV is a common cause of fever after solid organ transplantation, and evidence of CMV infection occurs in approximately 30% of patients. The most common presentation for CMV infection is that of a febrile, leukopenic patient with a cough, diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray, and hypoxia. HSV infection causes primarily oral pharyngeal ulcerations in most cases, although sporadic cases of disseminated disease have been reported. EBV causes an occasional case of mononucleosis-type syndrome but has also been clearly indicated in the pathogenesis of post-transplantation lymphomas. VZV infection can present as disseminated and occasionally life-threatening infections in the nonimmune transplant patient or as painful herpes zoster in patients who have previously developed chicken pox. 207 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning necrotizing fascitis. Necrotizing fascitis is an uncommon infection of the deep and superficial fascia that is associated with mortality as high as 40% in many series. Although many underlying disease processes predispose patients to necrotizing fascitis, three common factors are almost invariably present: 1) impairment of the immune system; 2) compromise of fascial blood supply, and 3) the presence of microorganisms that are able to proliferate within this environment. Infections of this type are usually polymicrobial in nature, with gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacteria, and gram-negative anaerobic being frequently identified. These polymicrobial cultural results are assuredly indicative of the occurrence of a synergistic process, perhaps in large part accounting for the severity of these infections. Some microorganisms possess virulence factors that, in conjunction with an underlying host predisposition, allow this disease process to occur without dependence on other bacteria. Examples of such bacteria include Clostridium, Pseudomonas, and Aeromonas. In these patients, the process is often fulminant and is frequently associated with cellulitis, myositis, fascitis, and bacteremia with attendant high mortality. 208 New treatment modalities designed to modulate host defense mechanisms that have been demonstrated conclusively to be of benefit include: Selective gut decontamination involves the use of orally administered antibiotics that achieve a high intraluminal level directed against gram-negative aerobes and yeast, leaving the host anaerobic intestinal microflora relatively undisrupted. Although a reduction and alteration of the microorganisms responsible for infectious episodes have been demonstrated in certain groups of patients, a clear-cut impact on host mortality has not been shown. Because LPS may be responsible for toxicity both directly and through host mediator systems, the availability of agents to bind against this portion of the gram-negative bacteria to reduce mortality has been intensively examined. Unfortunately, large multicenter randomized trials provide no evidence of benefit for this treatment. Similarly, since many of the systemic manifestations of gram-negative bacteremia are mediated by cytokines, the effect of an anti-TNF antibody preparation is currently in clinical trial. No proven benefits have yet been identified. Finally, the use of immunostimulants to enhance the state of activation of host defenses has been proposed. Thymopentin is a peptide that contains active thymopoetin, a thymic molecule that acts to stimulate T-lymphocyte activity. Preliminary trials indicate that this agent ameliorates host septic response after major operations and trauma but conclusive evidence that concurrent reduction of infection-related mortality occurs is not available.",

        "explanation": "Penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams possess a b-lactam ring of some type and act to bind bacterial division plate proteins, thus inhibiting cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis and either causing or inducing autolytic bacteriolysis. Because gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria possess different types of division plate proteins, many of these agents exhibit differential activity between these two types of microorganisms. Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and macrolides inhibit bacterial ribosomal activity, and thus overall protein synthesis by a variety of different mechanisms. Aminoglycosides act to inhibit protein synthesis and also presumably act on a different target site, a supposition based on the fact that aminoglycosides are bacteriolytic and the other agents are bacteriostatic. Vancomycin inhibits assembly of peptidoglycan polymers, whereas quinolones bind to DNA helicase proteins and inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim act in different mechanisms to inhibit protein synthesis, therefore two agents in combination act synergistically. 210 The treatment of the following patient should include: The primary treatment for a perforated viscus is surgical, however antimicrobial therapy is an extremely important adjunct. Empiric antibiotic therapy for secondary bacterial peritonitis and intraabdominal abscess should be directed against both aerobes and anaerobes. Administration of an agent directed against only one component of the infection or the other is inferior to combined therapy. Several studies indicate that the results of using several agents in combination is equivalent to the use of a single agent therapy as long as the agents selected possess activity against both components of the infection. The addition of antientercoccal or antifungal agents as initial therapy has not been substantiated. The most beneficial duration of antibiotic therapy must be based on the setting for the specific patient. Minimal peritoneal contamination with adequate surgical treatment may be treated with a three-to five-day course of antibiotics, whereas longer periods are indicated for immunosuppressed patients and with patients with extensive contamination. 211 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning host defense mechanisms to intraabdominal infection. The introduction of microorganisms into the normally sterile peritoneal environment invoke several potent specialized host antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Bacterial clearance, also termed translymphatic absorption, occurs through specialized structures found only on the peritoneal mesothelium on the underside of the diaphragm that act as conduits for both fluid and particulate matter. Lymphatic channels eventually form which drain into the venous circulation via the thoracic duct. Bacteria not cleared via translymphatic absorption are rapidly engulfed by resident and recruited phagocytic cells including resident macrophages on the peritoneal surface and omentum and attracted PMNs. The final primitive host defense mechanism is sequestration by which a fibrinogen-rich exudate containing plasma oposonins appears during peritoneal infection and fibrin polymerization occurs. Fibrin has the capacity to trap large numbers of bacteria and other particulate matter. Acting in conjunction with omentum and other mobile viscera, perforations are sealed and the contaminated enteric contents walled off, preventing continued soilage of the peritoneal cavity. 212 A 67-year-old male presents with an intraabdominal abscess secondary to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. The following statement(s) is/are true concerning his intraabdominal abscess. Typically an intraabdominal infection results in perforation of a hollow viscus and the ensuing contamination of a normally sterile peritoneal cavity. The normal bacterial flora found in that particular location of the alimentary tract thus determines the initial inoculum. In parallel with the overall quantity of microorganisms, (both aerobes but predominantly anaerobes) perforations of the lower small bowel and colon produce a high frequency of infections that contain anaerobic microorganisms. Certain predictable patterns of bacterial islets are found, but on average four to five islets occur in patients with established intraabdominal infection, more than half of which are anaerobes. Both aerobes and anaerobes are encountered in 80% to 90% of specimens. Commonly encountered aerobes isolated are E. coli and other gram-negative enteric bacilli such as Enterobacter, Klebsiella. Among the anaerobes, Bacteroides species (especially B. fragilis, Clostridium), and anaerobic cocci are most consistently isolated. 213 The following statement(s) is/are true concerning gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Gram-negative bacterial sepsis is a serious disease process that produces substantial morbidity and mortality in both normal and immunocompromised patients (10% to 20% and 30% lethality, respectively), despite therapeutic intervention with antimicrobial agents, aggressive hemodynamic monitoring, fluid resuscitation, and metabolic support. During the past several decades, nosocomial infections due to gram-negative pathogens have increased in frequency with resultant increase in the incidence of gram-negative bacteremia to between 3 and 13 cases per 1000 hospital admissions. Factors that predispose to these infections include: 1) underlying host disease processes such as malignancy, diabetes; 2) old age and disability; 3) malnutrition; 4) previous or concurrent antimicrobial antibiotic therapy; 5) major operations; 6) respiratory or urinary manipulation or intubation; and 7) immunosuppression. Although many different organisms cause this form of sepsis, E. coli predominates in overall frequency. Also common are isolates of Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Serratia; Pseudomonas bacteremia is less common. Some studies, however, have suggested that Pseudomonas sepsis is associated with the highest lethality. In several series, 10% to 20% of patients have had polymicrobial series, and most investigators agree that polymicrobial sepsis is more lethal than infection with a single organism.",

        "explanation": "Classification schemes of shock based on cause have been developed for the seemingly dissimilar processes leading to circulatory collapse and the shock state. Hypovolemic shock, the most common, is the result of intravascular volume depletion through loss of red blood cell mass or plasma volume. Microvascular hypotension results from a combination of low intravascular blood volume, diminished cardiac output, and compensatory sympathetic peripheral vasoconstriction. Shock associated with trauma (traumatic shock) arises from the consequences of hypovolemia due to hemorrhage in conjunction with direct soft tissue injury and bone fracture. Hypovolemia caused by blood loss and fluid extravasation into injured tissues is compounded by activation of maladaptive inflammatory cascades initiated by the tissue injury. In contrast to pure hemorragic shock, subsequent organ injury and multiorgan failure syndrome (MOFS) occurs much more frequently following traumatic shock due to the over-expression of these immuno-inflammatory cascades. Cardiogenic shock is the result of failure of the heart as an effective pump, resulting in inadequate cardiac output, tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. Intrinsic causes include myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or rhythm disturbances. Compressive cardiogenic shock is a discrete entity that results when extrinsic compression of the heart limits diastolic filling and thus systolic ejection and cardiac output. Septic shock refers to hypotension and circulatory insufficiency developing as a consequence of infection and the systemic response to that infection. In its hyperdynamic form, septic shock is marked by diminished peripheral vascular resistance and generalized vasodilatation causing relative hypovolemia. In contrast, hypodynamic septic shock occurs in situations of inadequate resuscitation or preterminal cardiovascular decompensation, and is associated with vasoconstriction and a greatly increased mortality risk. Sympathetic denervation through spinal cord injury, spinal anesthesia, or severe head injury produces generalized arterial vasodilatation and venodilation. Shock occurs when the normal blood volume fails to fill the available intravascular space and severe relative hypovolemia exists. Despite hypotension, there is a noteworthy absence of sympathetic activity, as occurs in hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock. Profound shock can occur in surgical patients following stress due to the loss of the homeostatic corticosteroid response. Hemodynamic instability may develop after an operative procedure or coincident with an unrelated illness. The profound circulatory collapse is often refractory to vigorous resuscitation with fluids and pressor agents. The response to exogenous corticosteroids is usually dramatic and potentially life-saving.",

        "explanation": "A broad spectrum of metabolic abnormalities become apparent in sepsis and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome following shock. Disruption of the normal cycles of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and oxygen metabolism occur as hypermetabolism develops. Through the Cori cycle, lactate from the periphery is shuttled back to the liver, where it is used in the production of glucose. Because pyruvate is converted to alanine in the periphery, flux of alanine also contributes to hepatic gluconeogenesis. The glycolytic oxidation of glucose to pyruvate and its subsequent glugoneogenic regeneration from lactate is an inefficient cycling of substrate. There is no net energy production, but heat is released in significant quantities. Alterations in lipid metabolism cause a progressive rise in the serum triglyceride level as a result of less efficient clearance of exogenous triglycerides coupled with increased hepatic lipogenesis. Profound alterations in protein and amino acid metabolism develop with characteristic changes in amino acid levels, nitrogen balance, and skeletal muscle mass. Initially levels of the branch chain amino acids are reduced, whereas those of the aromatic amino acids are elevated. There is an increase in the oxidative metabolism of protein to meet energy needs and a tremendous mobilization of nitrogen with net negative nitrogen balance. The branch chain amino acids are preferentially utilized in the TCA cycle to maintain an activity that otherwise would be lost from the diminished entry of carbohydrate-and fatty acid-generated acetyl coenzyme A. This results in reduced serum level of leucine, isoleucine and valine.",

        ],
        "explanation": "Moderate hypovolemia results in a relatively rapid spontaneous restitution of intravascular volume through expansion of the plasma space. This plasma expansion by erythrocyte free fluid occurs within one hour as a result of alterations in pressure and osmolarity and produces an associated hemodilution. Sympathetic discharge, associated arteriolar constriction, and induced metabolic changes in osmolarity initiate the compensatory events at the microcirculatory level. The initial pressure-related phase of restitution of blood volume in shock is overlapped by a second phase involving osmotically induced mobilization of intracellular fluid. Osmotic mechanisms contributing to the restitution of blood volume after moderate hemorrhage are not adequate in hemorrhage of greater magnitude. In larger hemorrhages (over 25% blood volume), there is also deterioration of the normal cellular transmembrane potential, an increase in intracellular sodium and water, and a concomitant decrease in extracellular fluid volume. Tissue hypoxia results, anaerobic metabolites accumulate, and the cell cannot maintain the normal cell membrane potential. Accumulation of hydrogen ion, lactate, and other products of anaerobic metabolism override homeostatic vasomotor tone and contribute to a maladaptive vasodilatation, further augmenting hypotension and hypoperfusion. The uptake of fluid by the “failing” cell is a major source of food sequestration following shock. Loss of membrane function is proportional to both the extent and duration of shock or degrees of sepsis. The etiology of membrane failure is unclear but appears multifactorial. Loss of intracellular ATP energy stores during hypoperfusion or direct toxicity during sepsis may inhibit the membrane sodium-potassium pump. Cellular dysfunction also appears to be related to abnormal intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

        "explanation": "Contributing pathophysiologic processes to the pulmonary manifestations of shock include the pulmonary component of the cardiovascular response, disruption of the normal lung mechanics, and acute lung injury or ARDS due to sepsis. Pulmonary function may be further compromised by pathology intrinsic to the lung itself, including pulmonary contusion, aspiration, airway obstruction, pneumonia, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and atelectasis. The acute pulmonary vascular response to shock largely parallels that of the systemic vasculature. The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, which may proportionally exceed that of the systemic circulation, transiently accompanies the systemic adrenergic response. ARDS is a syndrome of progressive lung injury that may arise as a direct consequence of shock or other disease processes. The characteristic findings of ARDS are the presence of pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and significantly decreased lung compliance. The pulmonary edema is noncardiac in origin and occurs in the face of normal left heart pressures. The hypoxemia results from the development of intrapulmonary shunting and perfusion of under and nonventilated alveoli. The decrease in lung compliance results from the loss of surfactant and lung volume in combination with the presence of interstitial fluid and alveolar edema. Progressive histologic changes of ARDS become apparent in pulmonary capillaries, interstitium, and alveoli. Initially, interstitial edema develops with swelling of the capillary endothelial cells and the type I pneumocytes. The type I pneumocytes subsequently slough, and alveolar edema ensues. Functional surfactant is lost with a significant increase in alveoli opening pressure and decrease in alveolar surface tension. Mechanisms proposed in the pathogenesis of ARDS include injury from mediators of inflammation elaborated elsewhere, and from activated cellular blood elements.",

        "explanation": "Hypovolemic shock is readily diagnosed when there is an obvious source of volume loss and overt signs of hemodynamic instability and increased adrenergic output are present. After acute hemorrhage, hemoglobin and hematocrit values do not change until compensatory fluid shifts have occurred or exogenous fluid is administered. These values decrease once transcapillary refill, osmotic-induced shifts, or non-RBC volume resuscitation expands the blood volume. It is imperative that the distinction be made between hypovolemic and cardiogenic forms of shock, because appropriate therapy differs dramatically. Restoration of perfusion in hypovolemic shock requires reexpansion of circulating blood volume in conjunction with necessary interventions to control ongoing volume loss. Continued hemodynamic instability after fluid resuscitation implies that shock has not been reversed or that there is ongoing blood or volume loss. In severe, prolonged hypovolemia, ventricular contractile function may itself become depressed and require inotropic support to maintain ventricular performance, but in general, pharmacologic interventions directed toward increased contractility in situations of inadequate preload are ineffective, further complicate metabolic derangements, and are not indicated until adequate volume replacement has been completed. Complications are less frequent after treatment of hemorrhagic shock than in situations of septic or traumatic shock. In the later circumstances, the massive activation of inflammatory mediator response systems and consequences of their disseminated, indiscriminate cellular injury can be quite profound.",

        ],
        "explanation": "The neuroendocrine response to shock attempts to achieve restoration of effective blood volume, mobilization of metabolic substrates, and maintenance of central profusion. Both peripheral and central afferent stimuli to the central nervous system are involved in inducing this response. Hypotension, associated with a decrease in impulses from the aortic and carotid baroreceptors, disinhibits the vasomotor center. This disinhibition results in increased adrenergic output and decreased vagal activity. Sympathetic nerve endings release norepinephrine, inducing peripheral and splanchnic vasoconstriction which is responsible for greater than 80% of systemic vascular resistance and is a major contributor to maintenance of central organ perfusion and venous return. Plasma levels of both epinephrine and norepinephrine are elevated with injury, and the degree of the catecholamine elevation corresponds to the magnitude of injury. In shock the effects of endogenous epinephrine are largely metabolic. In addition to initiating autonomic nervous activity, the hypothalamus secretes releasing hormones, which induce the stress hormone release of the pituitary. As part of this response, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary is increased stimulating cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex. In conjunction with elevated plasma levels of cortisol and epinephrine, increased pancreatic secretion of glucagon accelerates hepatic gluconeogenesis and further aggravates the glucose intolerance that follows injury and sepsis. The secretion of renin is increased in responses to adrenergic discharge and decreased perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin allows formation of angiotensin I in the liver, which is then converted to angiotensin II in the lungs. Angiotensin II is an extremely effective vasoconstrictor that further augments sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction.",

          "C"

        "explanation": "Shock from cardiac compression occurs when external pressure on the heart impairs ventricular filling. Because ventricular filling is a function of venous return and myocardial compliance, any process that places pressure on the heart can cause compressive cardiogenic shock. Included among these are pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax, mediastinal hematoma, and positive pressure from mechanical ventilation. Any patient with hypotension after a wound in proximity of the heart should be considered to have compressive cardiogenic shock until proven otherwise. The classical clinical findings of pericardial tamponade include Beck’s triad of hypotension, neck vein distention and muffled heart sounds. Pulses paradoxus may be noted (this involves a decrease rather than the normal increase of systolic blood pressure with inspiration; values 10mmHg are significant). These findings, however, may be obscured in a noisy emergency room environment by positive pressure ventilation or by associated injuries. Placement of a CVP catheter confirms the elevation of right-sided filling pressure. If a pulmonary artery catheter has been placed, findings consistent with tamponade or other forms of cardiac compression are a trend toward equalization of chamber pressures as hypotension progresses. In the patient at risk, echocardiography is an extremely sensitive and noninvasive approach to demonstrate pericardial fluid and the need for operation. Pericardial tamponade must be relieved urgently and cardiac injuries require emergent sternotomy. Chest tube placement would not be appropriate as the sole treatment in this patient.",

        "correct": [
          "C"
        ],
        "explanation": "Neurogenic shock results from interruption of sympathetic vasomotor input and develops after spinal cord injury, spinal anesthesia, and severe head injury. Under normal conditions, baseline sympathetic activity establishes a degree of arteriolar and venous constriction. Ablation of this tone results in decreased systemic vascular resistance and a dramatic increase in venous capacity, causing hypotension due to relative hypovolemia. Arteriolar dilatation not only lowers the systemic vascular resistance but also allows previously unopened vascular beds to be perfused, greatly expanding venous capacity. Removal of sympathetic inputs to innervated portions of the venous system allows further venodilatation. Restoration of an effective, albeit expanded, intravascular volume may require extremely large volumes of resuscitation fluid to restore normal cardiac filling pressures. This will restore cardiac output and reverse hypotension. However, pharmacologic intervention with vasoactive drugs may be necessary and is preferable to excessive volume resuscitation. Post-shock sequelae are infrequent. Although there is significant hypotension with neurogenic shock, there is usually little if any hypoperfusion. Thus, activation of inflammatory cascade and subsequent organ injury rarely occur. A major pitfall in the management of neurogenic shock arises when there is coexistent hemorrhage or ongoing volume loss that is not appreciated. This is not an unusual situation because cervical spine trauma causing paraplegia or severe head injury is frequently associated with multiple injuries. Thus, in trauma the initial response to neurogenic shock is large volume resuscitation regardless of the presumed etiology. If hemodynamic instability persists after initial trauma resuscitation, one must assume that the cause is not neurogenic and search for occult blood loss or cardiogenic causes of shock.",

Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsiae, and protozoa have all been reported to produce a clinical picture of septic shock, but the overall response is independent of the specific type of invading organism. Septic shock develops as a consequence of the combination metabolic and circulatory derangements accompanying the systemic infection. It appears that the circulatory deficits are preceded by the metabolic abnormalities induced by infection. In fact, the circulatory changes in hyperdynamic sepsis appear to be an adaptive response to the underlying metabolic dysfunction. Cardiac output is high and systemic vascular resistance low in hyperdynamic septic shock. However, splanchnic vasoconstriction is pronounced even in the absence of systemic hypotension and even though systemic vascular resistance is reduced. Expansion of circulating blood volume can occur through either transcapillary refill or fluid resuscitation. Due to the ongoing inflammatory mediator-induced increases in capillary permeability and continued loss of intravascular volume, exogenous volume resuscitation must be provided to restore venous return and ventricular filling.",

Elevation of serum levels of TNF have been reported shortly after experimental trauma and shock, however, documentation of elevated circulating levels of TNF in human shock is less clear. Furthermore, circulating levels of TNF cannot be correlated with severity of tissue injury or shock. This variability is thought to be due to rapid clearance and uptake by membrane receptors and by soluble membrane receptors that are released from multiple cells following stress and injury. Following hypoperfusion the liver and gut appear to be the major source of TNF that is rapidly cleared but responsible for inducing hepatocyte changes following shock. The release of breakdown products and escape of bacterial and endotoxin through the damaged mucosal barrier of the gut following shock allows or induces activation of tissue-fixed macrophage (Kupffer cell) of the liver which then produces secondary inflammatory mediators contributing to the post-resuscitation clinical response and inflammatory mediator activation seen in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. TNF is central to inflammatory response, particularly in sepsis and following endotoxemia or bacteremia. TNF also induces secondary inflammatory responses through direct interaction with specific membrane receptors, TNF-r. Treatment with anti-TNF antibody in the experimental setting protects animals from the deleterious effects of lethal bacteremia and endotoxemia.

These mediator systems function primarily as parcrine and autocrine agents in the local environment and are not usually detectable systemically. The over-expression and systemic dissemination of these mediators produces the toxic autodestructive processes underlying multiorgan failure syndrome with attendant high mortality. The compliment cascade is activated in shock and tissue injury through both the classical and alternative pathways. Activation of either pathway results in generation of the anaphylatoxin, C3a and C5a, soluble products with potent systemic hemodynamic effects. The eicosanoids, which include the prostaglandins and leukotrienes are formed acutely from arachidonic acid released from the membrane phospholipid by phospholipase A2. Eicosanoids are not stored in any measurable level and are generated as needed from readily available arachidonic acid in response to various inflammatory phenomena. Platelets, white cells, and endothelial cells are a rich source of these compounds. Thromboxane (TXA2) is the major arachidonic acid metabolite elaborated by platelets. TXA2 induces intense vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation and degranulation, neutrophil margination in the microcirculation and bronchial constriction. PGI2, the major arachidonic acid metabolite formed by endothelial cells, serves a check against actions of TXA2. PGI2 is a vasodilator and a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Platelet aggravating factor is a potent phospholipid mediator released by neutrophils, platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells in response to ischemia, tissue injury and sepsis. Its effects include decreased cardiac function, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, bronchoconstriction, peripheral vasodilatation, and increased vascular permeability.",

Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of myocardial insufficiency, but contractile dysfunction may also rise as a consequence of cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or metabolic abnormalities. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring often establishes a specific nature of shock and allows appropriate treatment to be delivered in an effective and expedient manner. Hemodynamic findings consistent with cardiogenic shock include a low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance, with elevated cardiac filling pressures. The initial measures in the management of cardiogenic shock include the administration of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation (as needed), and appropriate treatment of dysrhythmias. Hypotension usually precludes the use of morphine sulfate and nitrates, drugs typically used in simple congestive heart failure to alleviate cardiac pain and ameliorate pulmonary vascular congestion. The use of beta-adrenergic agonists such as dopamine and dobutamine, in moderate doses, offers positive inotropic support without excessive alpha-adrenergic activity. Increasing the inotropic state of the heart shifts the entire Starling curve upward, resulting in increased cardiac output for each level of cardiac filling. Afterload reduction may prompt increases in cardiac output through decreases in resistance to flow. The use of nitroprusside or other dilators requires relative blood pressure stability and close hemodynamic monitoring. Infusion of afterload-reducing agents can be administered in conjunction with inotropic support.",

        "explanation": "During the ischemia and hypoperfusion phase, degradation of ATP stores essential to maintain cell integrity and significant loss of diffusible intracellular adenine neuclotides occurs. As ATP further degrades there is an elevation in plasma and intracellular levels of hypoxanthine and xanthene which upon restoration of perfusion and reoxygenation are catalyzed by xanthine oxidase resulting in the formation of superoxide radicals. These radicals plus others such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are generated and lead to endothelial and parenchymal cell injury through membrane lipid peroxidation and activation of critical enzymes. These radicals have also been shown to be involved in the expression of proinflammatory phenotype endothelial cells and on macraphages and neutrophils. The proinflammatory phenotype of the endothelium includes procoagulant activity and the expression of adhesion molecules on the membrane surface, including the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAN-1) and the selectins. The subsequent adhesion of activated neutrophils to the endothelial leads to an explosive oxidative burst producing additional radicals and extensive release of proteolytic enzymes leading to injury and disruption of the endothelial lining, extensive capillary leak, and massive interstitial edema. Passive immunization of animals with monoclonal antibodies to either the neutrophil adhesive complex or the endothelial selectins dramatically lessens ischemia/reperfusion microvascular injury.",

        "explanation": "Exchange of material between the vascular space and the cell of various tissues via the interstitial space is essential for organ viability and occurs at the capillary level. The filtration of capillary fluid into the interstitium and its subsequent reabsorption into the post capillary venule is governed by microvascular permeability in conjunction with the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. The relation of these forces to one another (and their net effects) are illustrated by what is termed Starling’s law of ultrafiltration. In normal circumstances, a net filtration from capillary to interstitium is effected by a relatively higher capillary hydrostatic pressure, whereas net reabsorption from the interstitium back into the post capillary venule occurs as hydrostatic pressure falls and oncotic forces predominate. Although the mechanisms controlling blood flow to the capillary bed are complicated and vary among the different tissues, certain concepts are useful. Poiseuille’s law describes the relation between flow of fluid through a tube and the tube length and radius, the fluid viscosity, and the pressure gradient between ends of the tube. The radius of the tube (or vessel) is the single most important variable, because flow is proportional to the radius to the fourth power. Vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory influences directly impact local blood flow, as well as flow to other tissues through secondary effects on the systemic pressure. This secondary effect of peripheral vasoconstriction maintains the pressure gradient for central perfusion of the heart and brain. Systemic blood flow meets most of its resistance at the arteriolar level. While the individual capillary radius is significantly smaller, the vast number of capillaries offers less total resistance. The vascular smooth muscle in arterioles has both a-and b- adrenergic receptors. Alpha stimulation affects vasoconstriction where beta stimulation affects vasodilatation. The efferent sympathetic fibers innervating the precapillary resistance vessels and the venous capacitance vessels release norepinephrine on stimulation, which induces smooth muscle contraction and narrowing of the caliber of the vessels. These contractions are potent enough that blood flow to entire capillary beds can be arrested by adrenergic vasoconstriction.",

Many times a “second hit” such as a nosocomial infection, which is most commonly pulmonary, is a complication which can frequently worsen the pulmonary condition. Renal function tends to be maintained early in the course unless the precipitating insult has been prompted by a sudden oliguric acute tubular necrosis. With persistent activation and inflammatory mediators, glomerular filtration falls and the development of oliguric or polyuric renal failure marks the gradual transition into MOFS. Gastrointestinal abnormalities include ileus, stress ulceration, diarrhea, and mucosal atrophy. Breakdown of the mucosal barrier allows translocation of bacteria and endotoxin.

The stress of illness, operation, or trauma typically requires that the adrenal glands secrete cortisol in excess of that required in the nonstressed state (approximately 3–4 fold). Insufficiency not otherwise apparent may manifest itself only after major physical stress. Findings associated with adrenal insufficiency include weakness, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Surgical patients with significant adrenal insufficiency need not present with the above findings. More typical is the development of refractory shock, frequently with hyperthermia, in the course of injury or illness. Hypotension may be dramatic despite massive volume resuscitation and pressor support. Laboratory findings suggesting hypoadrenalism include hyponatremia, hypochloremia and hyperkalemia. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be confirmed or excluded by means of an ACTH stimulation test. A significant major cortisol response should be elicited by ACTH administration.",

        "correct": [
          "A"
        ],
        "explanation": "Central in the general cardiovascular response to shock is the action of the heart itself. The principle determinants of cardiac function in the normal heart are the volume of blood available for the heart to pump (preload), the systolic contractile capability, and the diastolic filling of the ventricles. In hypovolemia, the two dynamic variables of cardiac function, ventricular filling and myocardial contractility remain paramount and determine the stroke volume. The product of stroke volume and heart rate in turn determines the cardiac output. Increases in ventricular end-diastolic volume, reflecting venous return, cause ventricular distention. Ventricular distention in turn produces increased volume output with each stroke, the Frank Starling mechanism. Contractile function may vary independent of volume status. Changes in the contractile function shift the Starling curve up and down, producing increases or decreases in stroke volume for any given end-diastolic volume. A fundamental requirement for cardiovascular function is adequate cardiac filling, and cardiac output cannot exceed venous return. The venous system contains nearly two-thirds of the total circulating blood volume, including 20% to 30% within the splanchnic venous system. Most of this volume resides in small veins, which comprise the bulk of venous capacitance. The venous system, especially that of the splanchnic circulation, becomes important in the physiologic compensation to hypoperfusion because it serves as a dynamic reservoir for the autoinfusion of blood volume involving both active and passive mechanisms. The splanchnic circulation makes major contributions to the maintenance of venous return, therefore, it is likely that sympathetic venoconstriction is responsible for a portion of the blood mobilized from the splanchnic venous circulation. Sympathetic mediated venoconstriction in skin and skeletal muscle is probably not as significant as a source of blood volume. Selective vasoconstriction occurs in response to alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation with increased sympathetic activity in shock. Sympathetic stimulation does not cause significant vasoconstriction of either cerebral or coronary vessels, with normal blood flow maintained in these circulations. Blood flow to the skin is sacrificed early, followed by that to the kidneys and splanchnic viscera.",

        ],
        "explanation": "Therapeutic adjustments of intravascular volume (preload) and systemic vascular resistance (afterload) form the basis of the treatment strategies for all forms of shock. Optimal volume resuscitation should precede measures to augment to contractile function of the heart. Inotropic agents are used in shock when there is inadequate cardiac output despite adequate circulating blood volume. Dopamine and dobutamine are often times first line agents in the pharmacologic treatment of shock. Dopamine, at low doses, stimulates dopaminergic receptors producing renal arteriolar vasodilatation with associated increases in renal blood flow, urine output, and sodium excretion. At moderate doses, stimulation of cardiac b-receptors produces increases in contractility and cardiac output with little effect on heart rate or blood pressure. At higher doses, peripheral vasoconstriction from increasing a activity becomes more pronounced, prompting significant increases in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Dobutamine’s predominant effect is an increasing cardiac contractility with lesser increases in heart rate. Some reduction of peripheral vascular resistance may also occur. When compared to dopamine, dobutamine produces less peripheral vasoconstriction and less chronotropic response. Norepinephrine exerts both a and b-adrenergic effects, with a effects being evident at lower infusion rates and a effects more prominent at high doses. The major use of norepinephrine in current practice is in the patient with hypotension that persists despite appropriate volume resuscitation and the use of inotropic agents. Renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictive effects of norephinepherine complicate its use, especially when support is needed for significant periods of time. Isoproterenol is a potent b-adrenergic agent. With isoproterenol, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and diastolic coronary feeling is limited by tachycardia or diminished diastolic pressure. Indications for the use of isoproterenol are fairly limited, because agents with fewer adverse effects have become available. Vasodilators are used to augment cardiac function through optimization of ventricular filling pressures (preload) and systemic vascular resistance (afterload) both of which reduce demands on the myocardium. Decreases in afterload prompt increases in cardiac output and venodilatation contributes to decreases in pulmonary venous pressure and central venous pressure. Hypotension, however, may develop therefore patients must have careful constant monitoring of arterial pressure and repeated hemodynamic measurements with a pulmonary artery catheter.",

Fundamental concerns are control of the source of infection, inflammation or instability; restoration of microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen transfer, and the institution of optimal supportive care. Both the prevention and therapy of MOFS, therefore, requires source control and restoration of adequate profusion. Resuscitation efforts are directed toward restoration of adequate microcirculatory blood flow in all organ systems. Restoration of normal clinical parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate, urine output, and acid-base balance does not ensure optimal resuscitation. The physiologic endpoint that most closely corresponds with adequate microcirculatory flow is the level of cardiac output and the oxygen delivery at which oxygen consumption and lactate production remain independent of flow. The importance of metabolic support in the patient with MOFS cannot be overemphasized. The malnutrition of MOFS is markedly different than that of starvation and the nutritional requirements also differ. If optimal quantities of appropriately formulated amino acid solutions are given, protein synthetic rates can approach catabolic rates and the goal of nitrogen balance can be achieved. Formulas rich in branch chain amino acids appear to be more efficient in promoting nitrogen retention and minimizing urea production. Whenever feasible, enteral feeding is preferred over TPN because evidence suggests that bacterial translocation from the gut can be limited through the use of enteral feeds. Enteral absorption and processing of nutrients appears superior to TPN and lessens overall complications.",

Endothelial injury, platelet aggregation and activation of macrophages and neutrophils occur, and the clotting, fibrinolytic, kinin, and complement cascades are activated, along with the release of potent inflammatory cytokines. The effects of shock, resuscitation, and reperfusion, and the subsequent development of MOFS appear to be critically dependent on changes in the splanchnic and pulmonary microcirculations. These vascular beds appear to be major sites of activation of subsequent inflammatory mediator production that underlies the diffuse systemic inflammatory response. Extensive activation of the liver Kupffer cell and release of inflammatory mediators coupled with the ongoing release of activated neutrophils and by-products of activated gut macrophages is responsible for the injury to the pulmonary microcirculation and secondary induction of alveolar macrophage and additional inflammatory mediator systems. Excessive and persistent macrophage activation plays an essential role in MOFS and is hypothesized to represent the penultimate step in a series of continuous immuno-inflammatory stimulatory events, including local hypoxia, exposure to bacteria and toxins, and mediator release from localized areas of inflammation. When infection is the underlying or major contributing process, the diffuse inflammatory response develops independently of the specific type of microorganism. In noninfectious cases, the response also appears independent of the specific underlying cause.",

        "explanation": "Although physical findings are often adequate to establish a diagnosis and institute management of cardiac failure, direct measurement of filling pressures of the right heart (central venous pressure) or the left heart (pulmonary artery pressure) may be required. Placement of a pulmonary artery catheter allows us to measure cardiac output by thermodilution and, more importantly, to sample mixed venous blood for saturation measurements which tell us the ratio between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. From all of these measurements we can determine if cardiac output is normal for the level of filling pressure of the left ventricle, or if contractility is decreased. In the latter case, cardiac output will be lower than predicted for a given level of filling pressure. In the Frank-Starling curve, if the patient is to the right of the normal range, then cardiac function is compromised either because of valvular disease, extrinsic pressure such as pericardial tamponade, or more commonly, a decrease in contractility. If cardiac function and anatomy are normal, then blood volume, filling pressure and cardiac function are related to the Starling curve. The intake and output of fluid and salt is autoregulated to maintain the filling pressure of the left ventricle around 10 mm Hg. Extracellular fluid expansion is usually associated with normal blood volume. Gross expansion of extracelluar space results in deleterious effects if tissue edema can and often do exist with perfectly normal blood volume. In other words, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 5–10 does not rule out fluid overload as a cause of pulmonary or GI dysfunction. In critically ill patients, the fear of hypotension and effect of perfusion usually results in infusion of intravenous salt and water in quantities which exceed losses. Consequently, most patients in the Intensive Care Unit have anemia, dilutional hypoproteinemia, and a compensatory increase in cardiac output. In response to anemia, these patients are tachycardic, even though blood volume is normal, filling pressures are normal, and total body extracellular fluid is excessive.",

The best results are usually achieved by supplying approximately half the calories as carbohydrate and half as fat. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, energy source is provided as carbohydrate, fat, and amino acid solutions.

Conversely, a primary change in oxygen delivery is not followed by any change in oxygen consumption. The normal ratio of oxygen delivery to consumption is approximately 5:1.",

Usually arterial blood is fully saturated, and under normal circumstances, the saturation of mixed venous blood (SVO2) will be 80%. This measurement must be made in mixed venous blood since the relative extraction of organs served by the superior and inferior vena cava and coronary sinus are quite different. As long as arterial blood is fully saturated, this observation holds true regardless of the absolute level of oxygen consumption or oxygen delivery.

A febrile patient with significant signs of septic toxicity will typically have an oxygen delivery at 1.5 to 2 times normal. It is very unusual for a critically ill patient to experience oxygen consumption greater than twice normal. This occurs only in situations of severe muscular exercise such as seizures or tetanus. During hypermetabolism, a change in oxygen consumption is followed promptly by a proportionate change in oxygen delivery. Hence, it is “normal” for a hypermetabolic patient to have a high cardiac output and pulse rate. Rarely the hyperdynamic response exceeds the increase in oxygen consumption, reflected in a ratio higher than 5:1 and venous saturation greater than 80%. Some patients cannot mount an increased oxygen delivery in response to increased oxygen consumption because of the combination of hypoxemia, anemia, and myocardial failure. If this occurs, then the oxygen delivery/oxygen consumption ratio will be less than 5:1. The patient will compensate for this by increased oxygen extraction, however, and the patient will remain stable as long as the ratio is greater than 2:1.",

        "explanation": "Treatment of pulmonary edema has two important goals, the first is to improve oxygenation if it is impaired, and the second is to minimize fibrosis and bacterial infection, which often accompany pulmonary edema caused by capillary injury. The treatment of interstitial edema is to maintain the hydrostatic pressure as low as compatible with adequate cardiac output and to raise the oncotic pressure selectively in the vascular space. These measures, combined with fluid restriction and diuresis, will decrease the amount of pulmonary edema. Since it is desirable to maintain filling pressures of the left ventricle as low as possible while maintaining a good cardiac output, inotropic drugs to improve left ventricular contractility are helpful. Isoproterenol or dopamine should be used, with serial cardiac output and filling pressure measurements. The first step in decreasing pulmonary edema is to decrease the pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure as low as is compatible with an adequate cardiac output. This is done by diuresis and fluid restriction. As the patient falls behind in blood volume, signs of hypovolemia may appear. Blood volume is then replenished with a fluid that stays in the vascular space. Packed red cells are ideal for this application. When the hematocrit is normal, concentrated salt-poor albumin should be used. This hyperoncotic fluid replenishes the blood volume by attracting interstitial fluid from throughout the body into the vascular space and supplements diuresis. This technique is useful even in the septic patient who may have increased capillary permeability and may loose albumin from the vascular space at a rapid rate. Even if albumin “leaks out”, the short term effects of expanding blood volume and decrease in edema will appear.",

Diffusion block and / mismatch can almost be completely overcome by breathing 100% oxygen, hence hypoxemia during exposure to high alveolar PO2 is caused by total / mismatch, so-called transpulmonary shunting or venous ad mixture. Under normal circumstances, about 5% of the blood entering the left atrium has been shunted away from the pulmonary capillaries, either as the result of bronchial nutritive blood flow or through thebesian veins opening directly into the left side of the heart. This phenomenon, combined with a normal minor / mismatch associated with breathing at rest and positional changes in pulmonary blood flow, result in the fact that normal arterial PO2 is 90–100 mm Hg and the normal O2 saturation is 98%.",

Therefore, the end tidal CO2 and the PaCO2 should be identical. End tidal CO2 measurement is a very useful continuous measurement of PaCO2 which can be used as a monitor when the lung is normal, as in ventilator weaning. Furthermore, the gradient between end tidal and arterial CO2, when it is large, acts as an indirect measure of nonperfused alveoli and/or compression volume. In patients who are ventilated with positive pressure ventilation, a significant end tidal PaCO2 gradient occurs only when peak airway pressures are very high (over 30 cm H2O) and the compression volume is a significant component of each exhaled breath.",

        "explanation": "Since protein is the functional and structural chemical of the body, most nutritional assessment techniques are estimates of protein reserves. The actual nitrogen balance can be measured by measuring the amount of nitrogen excreted. This is most conveniently done by measuring the amount of urea excreted in the urine, assuming that urea constitutes 85% of the total nitrogen excretion. Knowing nitrogen excretion, the amount of protein catabolized can be estimated and compared with the amount of protein ingested by the patient. Indirect assessments of protein reserves are based on single measurements of body substances that are dependent on rapid protein synthesis for maintenance of normal levels. Conventional serum proteins such as albumin and globulin are not affected by malnutrition until it is very severe. Proteins such as prealbumen and transferrin, which turn over more rapidly, are better indicators of protein status. Lymphocytes are rapidly destroyed and protein is required for the formation of new cells. Consequently, the absolute lymphocyte count is a useful measure of the status of protein reserves. The lymphocyte count is considered by some the best single “static” measurement characterizing nutritional status. Protein is also required for synthesizing the cells and mediators involved in skin test reactivity. Although skin test reactivity is a manifestation of lymphocyte-mediated immunity, its usefulness in patient assessment is probably that of assessment of the inflammatory response than lymphocyte activity per se. Some chronically and acutely malnourished patients convert from reactive to anergic, and reactivity can be restored by nutritional repletion. 245 Useful steps to optimize systemic oxygen delivery include: Optimizing systemic oxygen delivery in relationship to oxygen requirement is the primary goal of management. Improving oxygenation of the blood itself by improving alveolar inflation is only one of the steps in optimizing oxygen delivery. Equally or more important are treating anemia and optimizing cardiac output. Cardiac output should be optimized to maintain delivery of four to five times consumption. In general, this means avoiding those factors which decrease cardiac output, rather than actively trying to increase cardiac output. Blood pressure should be maintained high enough to provide coronary perfusion (over 50 mm Hg mean pressure) but not so high as to limit left ventricular function (over 90 mm Hg mean arterial pressure). Alveolar collapse is treated by cleaning the airways, avoiding 100% oxygen, and moving fluid from the lung or chest, and finally by the use of positive end exploratory pressure to hold open those alveoli which have been opened by other measures. The optimal level of PEEP is that level that maintains arterial oxygenation but does not decrease venous return or cardiac output. This optimal level is best determined by monitoring mixed venous saturation. Another step in optimizing lung function is to take advantage of the gravitational effects on pulmonary blood flow by turning the patient prone or to a full lateral position to direct blood flow to areas of optimal alveolar function. This step will often result in an opening in the closed posterior alveoli which have been compressed by the weight of the fluid in the lungs. At the same time that oxygen delivery is optimized, oxygen consumption should be decreased to normal or even below normal if necessary. Treating infection, providing adequate sedation, and establishing muscular paralysis decrease oxygen consumption, and decrease the need for oxygen delivery. 246 Phases of multiorgan failure will include: Clinically the multiple-organ failure patient progresses through well-defined phases. These phases include: Phase 1—a generalized increased capillary permeability resulting in edema, weight gain, and intravenous volume replacement, increased protein concentration in urine and lymph. Although the pulmonary microvasculature has been most thoroughly studied, it is apparent that the lung is simply the most obvious end organ in a generalized permeability defect. Phase 2—A hypermetabolic state, with increased oxygen consumption and a compensatory increase in oxygen delivery characterized by tachycardia and high cardiac output. This condition following systemic ischemic and reperfusion is similar to hypermetabolism following endotoxemia, localized sterile inflammation, and infusion of stress hormones, suggesting a common mechanism. Phase 3—Organ malfunction due to localized edema and cellular injury, particularly in the kidney, liver, brain, and host defense system. Hemorrhagic shock predisposes to bacterial translocation and endotoxin absorption from the intestine. Phase 4—In the absence of systemic sepsis, organs may recover to normalcy or may be irreversibly damaged, leading to a need for chronic support. If the organ failure phases lead to systemic infection or irreversible tissue damage in the lung or brain, the death of the entire organ is likely.",

        "explanation": "Acute tubular necrosis results from ischemia to the renal parenchyma and is the most common pathologic finding of acute renal failure. In conditions of diminishing renal blood flow, perfusion to the kidneys is first maintained by vasomotor responses which dilate the afferent arteriole and constrict the efferent arteriole. As continued hypotension occurs, the renin-angiotensin system is activated and vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole occurs which exacerbates corticohypoperfusion. Pigment nephropathy is a common cause of acute renal failure occurring after trauma, burns, operations, or hemodynamic catastrophe. With ischemia or blunt injury to large muscles, myoglobin is released into the circulation. In the kidney, it is filtered from blood and reabsorbed by the tubule. Although myoglobin is not a direct nephrotoxin, in the presence of aciduria, myoglobin is converted to ferrihemate, which is toxic to renal cells. Prevention of myoglobin-induced renal failure may include the use of diuretics and alkalinization of urine. Drug-induced acute renal failure is responsible for approximately 5% of all cases of acute renal failure. Through normal reabsorption and secretion, the kidney is exposed to high concentrations of drugs and solutes, which may be toxic. This problem is compounded by hypovolemia, which causes increased reabsorption of water and solutes and exposes the lumen to even higher concentrations of toxins. The incidence of radiographic contrast dye induced nephropathy is approximately 1 to 10% and may be predicted according to a number of risk factors which include contrast load, age, preexisting renal insufficiency, and diabetes. The incidence in patients with normal renal function is significantly lower at 1% to 2%.",

Arteriovenous access is accomplished by percutaneous cannulation of femoral artery and vein with a low incidence of complications. Although full systemic anticoagulation is not necessary for CAVH, heparinization of the extracorporial circuit is required. CAVH is run continuously for as many days as renal replacement is required. Experience with CAVH has demonstrated very little or no hemodynamic instability with treatment of critically ill renal failure patients. The stable nature of this therapy is attributed to a slow and continuous fluid and solute removal and to the fact that the membrane does not induce compliment activation when in contact with blood. Fluid balance and serum electrolyte concentrations can be titrated to any level in a matter of hours by manipulating the composition and rate of replacement solution. Solute clearance with CAVH is limited by the ultrafiltration and replacement fluid exchange rate. In patients with high urea generation rates, solute removal with CAVH may be inadequate and variations of the technique may be used to enhance clearance.",

Management of fluids, solutes, and nutrition is usually unaffected by nonoliguric renal failure, although BUN may be elevated. The extent of renal dysfunction is limited and almost always reversible. The use of renal replacement therapies is rarely necessary. Acute renal failure can result in severe derangements in electrolyte and acid-based physiology. Of all electrolyte abnormalities that might occur, hyperkalemia is the most serious. Other electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis are common and must be monitored carefully. The metabolic requirements of a patient with acute renal failure are those of a critically ill hospitalized patient. The actual measurements of resting energy expenditure has shown that caloric requirements for multiorgan failure patients with renal failure are often 50% above normal, healthy individuals. Although acute renal failure may require fluid restriction, providing adequate nutrition is an important aspect of their treatment. Positive energy balance may make management of uremia and hyperkalemia less difficult. By providing adequate calories, endogenous protein catabolism with resultant generation of urea and release of potassium can be avoided. Maintenance of positive energy balance with glucose and lipids should reduce protein catabolism, urea generation, and hyperkalemia.",

Respiratory failure is treated by mechanical assistance for lung inflation and ventilation and by decreasing lung edema as much as possible. Airway intubation is usually required. There is now good evidence that forced diuresis and negative fluid balance is associated with improved survival and acute respiratory failure. Cardiac failure is treated with inotropic drugs. Although ionotropic drugs are usually titrated to achieve a desired arterial blood pressure, it is more sensible to titrate ionotropes to achieve a normal oxygen delivery/oxygen consumption ratio. Pulmonary artery pressure and mixed venous saturation monitoring are essential for intelligent management of the patient with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. Adequate nutrition is also important for recovery from organ failure. Renal failure is treated by mechanical substitution of renal function. Although hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can serve this purpose, each has a significant drawback in the critically ill, multiple organ failure patient. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD) are the methods of choice for renal replacement therapy.

The decreased compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs because the lung is smaller, not stiffer. In acute respiratory failure, the cause of decreased compliance is almost always associated with a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC). The decreased FRC represents lost alveoli which are either collapsed or filled with fluid but still perfused with blood. Because the lung is smaller, the compliance curve has shifted to the right and much higher pressures are required to achieve the same level of inflation. Lung damage can be caused by high airway pressure, so that overdistension is not merely inefficient but actually detrimental. Since the most normal areas of lung have the best compliance, they are most vulnerable to overdistension, contributing to the steady progression of lung dysfunction in patients ventilated at high peak pressure.",

If the patient is comatose or paralyzed, the assist mode cannot be used and the rate is set in addition to the volume. Adequate weaning indices are: inspiratory force greater than 20 cm H2O, vital capacity twice the tidal volume, adequate gas exchange at assisted ventilation at FiO2 of 0.3 and 5 cm H2O of PEEP, and minute ventilation less than 10 L/min.

Consequently, reporting “per square meter” underestimates metabolism in a fat person and overestimates in a very lean person. Although most of studies on nutrition in critical illness have been based on estimated energy expenditure, actual measurement is much more accurate and has become an important aspect of critical care management. The most commonly used method of measurement is indirect calorimetry. In this method, the amount of oxygen absorbed across the lungs into the pulmonary blood is measured over a given period of time. Assuming the patient is at a metabolic steady state during this time, the amount of oxygen absorbed across the lungs is equal to the amount of oxygen consumed in the metabolic process. The metabolic rate, measured in cubic centimeters of oxygen/minute, can be converted to calories/hour or /day if the oxygenated substrates are known. For practical purposes, a conversion factor of 5 kcal of energy/liter of oxygen consumed is a reasonable approximation.",

However, when the loss in ventilation exceeds the decrease in perfusion, a ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs, which results in incomplete oxygenation of blood perfusing that area of the lung. The resultant hypoxemia stimulates an increased rate and depth of breathing which may serve to reexpand the person’s inflated area of lung. If it does not, hypoxemia will continue but increased ventilation in other areas of the lung will result in excess CO2 excretion, hypocapnea and respiratory alkalosis. The blood gas picture, hypoxemia with respiratory alklalosis, is the most common abnormality of gas exchange in surgical patients and it is a hallmark of ventilation-perfusion imbalance. Oxygenation of blood in the poorly ventilated area of lung can be improved by increasing concentration of oxygen in the inspired gas. The use of supplemental oxygen, however, treats the symptom rather than the basic cause and may actually make the problem worse by adding to absorption atelectasis, depriving the poorly ventilated area of nitrogen to hold alveoli open. This may result in total alveolar collapse. In this circumstance, blood perfusing the nonventilated area will mix with blood from other areas of the lung, resulting in hypoxemia that does not improve significantly in response of administration of oxygen. Aside from the effects on gas exchange, loss of alveolar space results in changes in the volume-pressure relationships in the lung. A decrease in functional residual capacity always results in a shift in the volume-pressure relationship toward a condition of decreasing compliance.",

Alone, neither is sufficient to result in metabolic alkalosis. Extracellular bicarbonate concentration is increased by numerous mechanisms. Loss of HCl is the leading cause of metabolic alkalosis in surgical patients. External loss of gastric acid results in net gain in bicarbonate, which causes metabolic alkalosis. Although the kidney can excrete excess bicarbonate, this must be accompanied by excretion of sodium. Renal excretion of sodium is limited in the face of volume depletion, which also occurs with external losses of gastric secretion. As volume depletion progresses, sodium is conserved in exchange for hydrogen. Thus, in metabolic alkalosis secondary to prolonged gastric outlet obstruction, the urine, although initially alkalotic, becomes paradoxically acidotic in prolonged or uncorrected cases. Hypokalemia and cellular exchange of potassium for hydrogen can also lead to metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia results in enhanced proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption and distal tubular acid secretion. The major compensatory mechanism in metabolic alkalosis is respiratory, since the presence of metabolic alkalosis implies renal dysfunction in either generating or failing to excrete increased amounts of bicarbonate. Hypoventilation is limited by the development of hypoxemia, which stimulates ventilation. Among the four major types of acid-base disorders, this compensatory mechanism is the least effective.",

Although pulmonary disease commonly causes hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis is far less common, since defusion of O2 is more readily impaired than diffusion of CO2. Increased PCO2 results in increased H2CO3 which disassociates into H+ and HCO3–. Cellular exchange of Na+ and K+ for H+ allows the reaction to continue in this direction with increased extracellular bicarbonate. This tissue buffering is accomplished within minutes. Persistently elevated PCO2 also stimulates increased renal acid excretion. Full renal compensation occurs over 3 to 5 days. The treatment of chronic compensated respiratory acidosis may be complicated by accompanying hypoxemia. In chronic hypercapnia, the chemical chemoreceptors may be insensitive and the accompanying hypoxemia may supply the main respiratory drive through the stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors. In such patients, complete correction of hypoxemia may further depress respiration and worsen the respiratory acidosis.",

        "explanation": "Changes in volume are detected both by osmoreceptors, which detect changes in plasma osmolality and baroreceptors, which are sensitive to changes in pressure. The osmoreceptors are responsible for day-to-day fine-tuning of volume whereas the baroreceptors contribute relatively little to the control of fluid balance under normal conditions. Changes in effective circulating volume are sensed by the volume receptors of the intrathoracic capacitance vessels and atria, the pressure receptors of the aortic arch and carotid arteries, the intrarenal baroreceptors, and, to a lesser extent, by the hepatic and cerebrospinal volume receptors. These baroreceptors control volume by means of sympathetic and parasympathetic connections. The atria also appear to serve as endocrine organs capable of directing responses to volume changes with the elaboration of the hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide. The major hormonal mediator of baroreceptor modulation of volume control is the renin-angiotensin system. The end result of this complex system of receptors or messengers is a change in sodium and water balance mediated by the kidneys. It is through changes in sodium and water reabsorption that volume and pressure ultimately normalize. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that is released in response to changes in arterial pressure, changes in delivery of sodium to the macula densa of the distal convoluted renal tubule, increases in beta adrenergic activity and increases in cellular cAMP. Renin cleaves angiotensin I from circulating angiotensinogen. Angiotensinogen is abundant, so this reaction is enzyme dependent rather than substrate dependent. Angiotensin I is further cleaved to angiotensin II which acts with locally and systemically to increase vascular tone. Angiotensin II affects sodium reabsorption by decreasing renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration coefficient. Finally, angiotensin II increases sodium reabsorption by direct tubular action as well as by stimulation of aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex. The importance of nitric oxide and its many biologic functions has recently been recognized. Nitric oxide participates in the regulation of renal hemodynamics and renal handling of water and electrolytes.",

        "explanation": "Calcium is a divalent cation found in abundance in the human body. About 99% of total body calcium is located in bone in the form of hydroxyapatite crystals. Calcium homeostasis depends on the exchange of calcium between bone and extracellular fluid, renal excretion, and intestinal absorption. These three processes are controlled to a great extent by parathyroid hormone. In extracellular fluid, calcium exists in three forms: ionized calcium, non-ionized calcium, and protein-bound calcium. Ionized calcium, which comprises about 45% of total calcium is responsible for most physiologic actions of calcium in the body, and its level is tightly controlled by a regulatory mechanisms. Some nonionized calcium is complexed with non-protein anions, including phosphate and citrate, and does not easily disassociate. These molecular forms make up only about 15% of total calcium present in plasma. About 40% of extracellular nonionized calcium is bound to proteins, with most being bound to albumin. Changes in either plasma protein levels or pH can alter the proportion of calcium in the ionized state. The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia can also occur secondary to malignant disease, caused either by a metastasis to bone or by autonomous tumor secretion of hormone-like substances that alter calcium homeostasis. Neuromuscular effects may be the earliest manifestations and include muscle fatigue, weakness, personality disorders, psychosis, confusion, and coma. Elevation of total serum calcium concentrations to greater than 14mg/dL requires prompt treatment to prevent any serious and potentially lethal complications. Immediate measures are directed toward maximizing renal excretion of calcium. Vigorous hydration with 0.9% saline solution to prompt diuresis should be the initial step in treatment. The addition of potassium to the resuscitation fluid as well as the use of furosemide can also be used for treatment. Serum calcium levels below 8 mg/dL may be associated with symptoms and signs that are primary manifestations of neuromuscular abnormalities. These include muscle cramps, perioral tingling, parastesias, laryngeal stridor, tetany, seizures and psychotic behavior. Classic signs of hypocalcemia include hyperactive, deep tendon reflexes, Cvostek’s sign, and Trousseau’s sign. Symptomatic hypocalcemia is best treated with intravenous infusion of calcium in the form of calcium gluconate or calcium chloride.",

The relationship between total body water (TBW) and body weight is relatively consistent for any given individual and depends on the amount of fat within the body. Because fat contains little water, TBW as a percentage of body weight decreases with increasing body fat. The estimated TBW in men is 60% of body weight, whereas in women, who typically have more adipose tissue, the average TBW is 50% of body weight. The percentage of body weight accounted for by water also varies with age. In infants, water comprises about 80% of body weight. Throughout adult life, a gradual decrease occurs in TBW content because of the amount of fat within the body usually increases with age. In obese patients, estimates of TBW should be decreased by 10% to 20% whereas in lean patients, estimates should be increased by about 10%.

        ],
        "explanation": "The most common cause of hyponatremia is an excess of free water rather than a deficit of total body sodium. Hyponatremia is frequently seen in the postoperative or post-trauma patients because increased ADH secretion acts on the collecting tubules of the kidney to increase free water reabsorption. Although hyponatremia most often results from excess free water, it can occur in the presence of excess solute. In this situation, TBW content is either normal or diminished but the plasma osmolality is increased. An example of this hyperosmolar-hyponatremic state is untreated hyperglycemia. Excess solute may also be due to exogenous administration or ingestion of mannitol, ethanol, methanol, or ethylene glycol. Most surgical patients with hyponatremia are euvolemic or hypervolemic. Such patients, if asymptomatic, are best treated by free water restriction, since free water overload is the cause of the condition. Hypernatremia is a less common problem in surgical patients than hyponatremia and is usually the result of excess free water loss associated with hypovolemia. Hypernatremia may also be secondary to increased total body content of sodium, which is usually related to exogenous administration of sodium. The symptoms of hypernatremia are related to the hyperosmolar state. CNS effects predominate because of cellular dehydration as water passes into the extracellular space. Once hypernatremia becomes symptomatic, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt treatment of hypernatremia is essential. Rapid correction, however, of hypernatremia is associated with significant risk of cerebral edema and herniation. Because chronic hypernatremia is relatively well tolerated, there are few advantages to rapidly correcting the free water deficit. Moderate degrees of hypernatremia are tolerated well, and symptoms rarely develop unless serum sodium levels exceed 160 mEq/liter. The development of symptoms also depends on the rapidity at which hypernatremia develops.",

        ],
        "explanation": "Potassium is the major intracellular cation and is a major determinant of intracellular osmolality. Because of the large differences between intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations, a transmembrane potential is generated. Alterations in potassium concentration gradient (both hyper- and hypokalemia) have profound effects on transmembrane potential and consequently on cellular function. This is especially true for cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Extracellular potassium concentration is primarily determined by renal excretion. About 90% of ingested potassium is secreted by the urine. Hyperkalemia therefore rarely develops from excessive potassium intake in the absence of renal insufficiency, since the capacity for renal potassium excretion is large. In the surgical patient, diminished renal function is perhaps the most common problem leading to hyperkalemia. Both chronic and acute renal failure result in the deficit in potassium excretion. Hyperkalemia can also be associated with cellular disruption, such as with crush injuries or lysed erythrocytes in large hematomas or after massive blood transfusion. The clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia are primarily related to membrane depolarization. The most life-threatening manifestations are related to the cardiac effects of membrane depolarization. Mild hyperkalemia results in peaked T-waves on the EKG and may cause parethesia and weakness. More severe forms of hyperkalemia cause flattened P-waves, prolongation of the QRS complex, and deep S-waves on EKG. Ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest may follow. Severe hyperkalemia with EKG abnormalities requires urgent treatment. Rapid infusion of 10% to 20% calcium gluconate may reduce the effects of hyperkalemia on membrane potentials. Administration of sodium bicarbonate is another temporary measure. The increase in serum sodium antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the membrane potential, whereas the increase in extracellular pH shifts potassium into the cells. Movement of potassium into the intracellular compartment can also be achieved by giving insulin and glucose. Hypokalemia is usually caused by total body potassium depletion secondary to the decreased potassium intake, increased extra-renal potassium losses, or increased renal potassium losses. Decreased serum potassium levels may also be secondary to redistribution of potassium into the intracellular space. Symptoms of hypokalemia, like those of hyperkalemia, are manifested by disturbances in membrane potentials. As potassium levels fall below 2.5mEq/L, muscle weakness is common. The primary treatment of hypokalemia is potassium replacement. The route and rate of potassium replacement depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. A reduction in serum potassium of 1mEq/L represents a total body potassium deficiency of 100 to 200 mEq.",

        "explanation": "Most clinically significant metabolic acidosis is related to the net loss of bicarbonate, which occurs when consumption due to either loss or titration is greater than bicarbonate generation. Under normal circumstances of ingestion of the average amount of protein in an American diet, about 70 mEq acid is generated daily. The major source of acid production is sulfuric acid from the metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids. Increased protein intake and tissue catabolism resulting in greater metabolism of sulphur containing amino acids may lead to a generation of increased amounts of sulfuric acid. This excess acid utilizes excess bicarbonate for neutralization. Diarrhea, intestinal or pancreatic fistulas, and burns can cause metabolic acidosis secondary to loss of bicarbonate. The two most common types of organic acidosis are ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis. The abnormality primarily responsible for ketoacidosis is deficiency of insulin whether primary, as in diabetic ketoacidosis, or secondary to hypoglycemia. Under normal conditions a small amount of ketoacids is produced. During prolonged starvation, production of ketoacids increase to modest levels, providing an important source of energy to nonhepatic tissues, particularly the brain. In ketoacidosis, the ketoacid production is excessive because of insulin deficiency. In diabetic acidosis, insulin deficiency also contributes to hyperglycemia by decreasing the metabolism of glucose by extrahepatic tissue and increasing hepatic production of glucose. Lactic acidosis can be divided into type A, caused by tissue hypoxia, and type B, caused by other mechanisms. Hypoxia, the most common cause of lactic acidosis, impairs the mitochondrial oxidation of NADH to NAD that is necessary for glycolysis. Normal serum lactate concentration is below 2 mEq/L. Lactate acidosis is secondary to hypoxemia, usually due to an increased production of lactate as well as decreased use, and serum lactate concentrations greater than 6 mEq/L. The most common cause of type B lactate acidosis is ethanol intoxication.",

        "explanation": "Body fluids are aqueous solutions composed primarily of water and contained in different compartments of the body. The movement of water from these compartments depends on a number of physical properties, the most important of which is osmosis. According to the principles of osmosis, if two solutions are separated by semipermeable membrane, water moves across the membrane to equalize the concentration of the osmotically active particles. The osmotic activity across a semipermeable membrane is determined by the concentration of solutes on each side of the membrane. The body is capable of fine regulation of solute and water concentrations, so that osmolality remains fairly constant at an average of 289 mOsm/kg H2O. In response to small changes in cell volume, osmoreceptors in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus send signals to the neuronal centers that control the two primary regulators of water balance, thirst and antidiuretic hormone secretion. Changes in TBW are reflected by changes in extracellular solute concentration. Because sodium is the primary extracellular cation and potassium is the predominant intracellular cation, the serum sodium approximates the sum of the exchangeable total body sodium and exchangeable total body potassium divided by the TBW. Because total body solute content remains relatively stable over time, changes in TBW content result in inversely proportional changes in serum sodium. Thus, abnormalities in serum sodium are the indication of abnormal TBW content. In contrast to impermeable solutes that are excluded from the intracellular space, such as sodium, permeable solutes such as urea can freely cross the cell membranes. Although urea contributes to the osmolality of a solution, it has no effect on tonicity because it distributes equally across membranes, and as such does not contribute to the osmols that affects cell volume.",

Maximal renal compensation requires 2 to 4 days. Delay in achieving maximal renal response to an increased acid load causes blood pH to decline, which stimulates hyperventilation. Although effective in promptly raising blood pH, ventilatory compensation is only partial, and full respiration compensation requires 12 to 24 hours. The major principal of treatment for mild to moderate acute metabolic acidosis is correction of the underlying cause. In surgical and trauma patients, metabolic acidosis is often the result of hypoxia secondary to inadequate tissue perfusion and subsequent lactic acidosis. Volume and/or blood resuscitation alone may be enough to correct the acidosis. Attempts to correct acidosis with exogenous bicarbonate before correction of inadequate tissue perfusion are usually unsuccessful. The use of bicarbonate for the treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial at best. In several studies the use of bicarbonate in patients with lactic acidosis does not improve clinical parameters or outcome. The correction of both acidosis and hypoglycemia of diabetic ketoacidosis is best achieved by the administration of insulin. Volume resuscitation is also required. Potassium replacement is essential, even in the face of normal or high serum potassium, and as hypokalemia develops as acidosis in hyperglycemia are corrected.",

Renal tubular acidosis may be classified as distal or proximal, depending on the primary site of the renal tubular defect leading to acidosis.

Maintenance fluid should be supplemented by replacement of the additional fluids needed to replace the ongoing third space loss as well as losses from various tubes and drains. In general, isotonic solution should be used for volume resuscitation during the early postoperative period. It is best not to give potassium supplements during this period unless they are specifically required as indicated by serum electrolyte measurements. Monitoring fluid status during the postoperative period is best accomplished by careful monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and central venous pressure, if necessary. Urine output is maintained at a level greater than 0.5 mL/kg/h. A urine specific gravity of greater than 1.010 to 1.012 indicates that urine is being concentrated and the patient may not be receiving adequate hydration.",

        "explanation": "A number of electrolytes solutions are available for parenteral administration. Lactated Ringer’s solution is a physiologic solution containing many of the electrolytes found in plasma. The disadvantage of this solution is the relatively low sodium content (130 mEq/L) as compared to plasma. Hyponatremia can occur with extended use of lactated Ringer’s solution. Isotonic saline (0.9% or normal saline) contains 154 mEq of both sodium and chloride. The excess of both sodium and chloride can lead to electrolyte and acid-base disturbances. Infusion of large volumes of 0.9% saline can lead to total body sodium overload and hyperchloremia. The less-concentrated saline solutions are hypo-osmotic and have excess free water. In addition, 0.2% saline solution is hypotonic with respect to plasma and can result in red blood cell lysis if rapidly infused. For this reason, 5% dextrose is added to these solutions to increase the tonicity. Plasma expanders are commonly used in surgical patients. Plasma protein solutions such as 5% and 25% albumin act initially by increasing plasma oncotic pressures. Abnormalities in microvascular permeability such as those found in the pulmonary circulation in adult respiratory distress syndrome, in regional circulatory bed burns or infections, and in the systemic circulation in sepsis, may result in extravasation of these proteins into the interstitial space. About half of all exogenously administered albumin eventually ends up in the extravascular space. The half life of exogenously administered albumin is about 11 days.",

The two most common causes of hypoxia resulting in respiratory alkalosis are pulmonary disease and exposure to high altitudes. Renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis is not achieved by increasing excretion of bicarbonate but by decreasing net acid excretion, primarily through the reduction in ammonia excretion and increases in organic anion excretion. Chronic respiratory alkalosis is generally asymptomatic. Acute respiratory alkalosis may cause sensations of breathlessness, dizziness, and nervousness and can result in circumoral and extremity parathesias, altered levels of consciousness, and tetany. These signs are related to decreased cerebral blood flow secondary to decreased PCO2 and decreased ionized calcium concentration secondary to increased blood pH.

          "B",
          "C"
        ],
        "explanation": "Renal failure is the primary cause of hypermagnesemia. Because of the kidneys ability to excrete large magnesium loads, hypermagnesemia rarely occurs if renal function remains normal. Because the kidneys are able to conserve magnesium well in states of magnesium depletion, hypomagnesemia rarely occurs from poor intake alone. The combination of low intake and increased gastrointestinal loss may lead to hypomagnesemia. Prolonged periods of intravenous fluid replacement without magnesium replacement and the chronic use of loop diuretics or other medications such as cyclosporine or aminoglycosides can also result in hypomagnesemia. Deficiencies of magnesium may present signs and symptoms similar to hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia may be treated by the oral administration of magnesium however large doses frequently leads to diarrhea. Correction of major deficits is therefore best managed by intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate at a dose of 50 to 100 mEq/d. 284 Muscle relaxants are a class of anesthetic agents used to prevent movement and facilitate surgical exposure. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true concerning the use of muscle relaxants in surgical procedures. Neuromuscular blocking agents can be classified as depolarizing or nondepolarizing inhibitors of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The only noncompetitive inhibitor employed clinically is succinylcholine. This drug rapidly binds to the neuromuscular junction and produces depolarization, clinically obvious as fine muscle fasciculations occurring approximately 60 seconds after injection. All other clinically useful muscle relaxants are termed competitive inhibitors and do cause depolarization when they attach to the neuromuscular junction. Since these agents compete with acetylcholine, the block produced is in direct proportion to the concentration of the agent relative to the concentration of acetylcholine. If the concentration ratio is low enough, competitive relaxants can be “reversed” if the concentration of acetylcholine is artificially elevated. Increase of acetylcholine concentration can be achieved by giving a drug which blocks metabolism of anticholinesterase (neostigmine). Nondepolarizing relaxants are frequently used in critically ill patients who are difficult to manage otherwise during prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation. It is imperative that these drugs be given in conjunction with analgesics and amnesic agents, since neuromuscular blocking agents have no analgesic or amnestic properties and only prevent motion of voluntary muscles. Patients may therefore be totally aware and in pain and unable to communicate. All muscles of the body do not have equal sensitivity in muscle relaxants. The diaphragm is both resistant to neuromuscular blockade while the neck and pharyngeal muscles that support the airway are most sensitive. It is possible for an intubated patient to spontaneously ventilate and even to produce a large negative inspiratory force and yet have complete airway obstruction when extubated due to effects of residual muscle relaxants on upper airway muscles. The definitive clinical test for complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade is the ability of the patient to sustain a head lift from the bed for five seconds. 285 Local anesthetics are essential agents used in current surgical practice. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true concerning the use of local anesthetic agents. Local anesthetics constitute a class of drugs which produce temporary blockage of nerve conduction by binding to neuronal sodium channels. Adverse consequences associated with the use of local anesthetics fall into three categories: acute central nervous system toxicity due to excessive plasma concentration, hemodynamic and respiratory consequences due to excessive conduction block of the sympathetic or motor nerves, and allergic reactions. Whenever a local anesthetic has been injected, there may be inadvertent intravascular injection or an overdose of the drug due to rapid uptake from the tissues. All may produce seizures. Complications can be minimized by aspirating prior to injection to avoid intravascular injection and limiting the doses to the safe range. When local anesthetics are administered for a spinal or epidural block, there will be a progressive blockade of the sympathetic nervous system which will produce systemic vasodilatation. If the block travels along the thoracolumbar region, a sympathetic blockade will result in profound systemic vasodilatation and bradycardia with resultant hypotension. Local anesthetics are divided into two groups: esters and amides. Most commonly used agents, the amides, include lidocaine and bupivacaine. Lidocaine is noted for a fast onset of action but a short duration whereas bupivacaine has a slower onset with the duration lasting for four to 12 hours. The addition of epinephrine (100 µg) will lower the toxicity and increase the duration of the local anesthetic.",

        "explanation": "The history of myocardial infarction is an important risk factor for general anesthesia. Large retrospective studies have found that the incidence of reinfarction is related to the time elapsed since the previous myocardial infarction. The incidence of reinfarction appears to stabilize at approximately 1% after six months, with the highest rate of reinfarction occurring in the first three months after the infarct. Mortality from reinfarction, for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, has been reported to be between 20–50% and usually occurs within the first 48 hours after surgery. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheters and aggressive pharmacologic intervention has been demonstrated to reduce reinfarction rates. 287 General anesthesia is not without risks. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true concerning the risk associated with general anesthesia. Anesthetic agents effectively obtund or completely block nearly all physiologic protective mechanisms, therefore, there is an associated risk even without a surgical procedure. Fortunately, with the advent of newer agents and monitoring techniques, it is estimated the mortality due to anesthesia alone has decreased from approximately 1:10,000 in the 1950s to as low as 1:100,000 or less for healthy patients today. It has been estimated that between 50–75% of anesthetic-related deaths are due to human error and are preventable. The most common problems associated with adverse outcomes are related to the airway: inadequate ventilation, unrecognized esophageal intubation, unrecognized extubation, and unrecognized disconnection from the ventilator. 288 Over the last decade, the routine use of both invasive and noninvasive monitoring devices has been instituted for the administration of most anesthetics. The following statement(s) is/are true concerning monitoring of the surgical patient. Pulse oximetry continuously, noninvasively and inexpensively provides arterial hemoglobin saturation and peripheral pulse determination. It must be remembered, however, that a pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation and not arterial oxygen tension (PaO2). The PaO2 must drop below 80 mm Hg before any significant change in oxygen saturation will occur. End tidal CO2 monitoring reflects metabolism (the production of CO2), circulation (blood flow to the lungs), and ventilation (respiratory rate in an intact ventilatory circuit). It can be used as a surveillance monitor for both the respiratory circuit and the cardiovascular system. Any acute decrease in cardiac output will decrease output to the lung and increase alveolar dead space, causing an acute drop in end tidal CO2. Hemodynamic stability can be monitored in a variety of methods, the most basic of which is systemic arterial blood pressure measure. Intermittent, noninvasive measure of systemic blood pressure with an oscillometric blood pressure cuff has become the standard in the operating room with an accuracy equal to that of clinical measurement by auscultation. When tighter control is required in patients with significant hypertension, serious heart disease, or in patients who may suffer acute blood loss, invasive arterial monitoring is employed. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing extended surgical procedures with significant fluid shifts and potential blood loss, central venous pressure monitoring is frequently used, with pulmonary arterial catheter monitoring reserved for more critically ill patients and for those with significant left ventricular dysfunction.",

        "explanation": "Twenty-four percent of patients experience a post-anesthetic care unit complication. Nausea, vomiting and airway support comprise 70% of these complications. The need to maintain airway support is by far the most common respiratory complication. Hypothermia has a deleterious effect on altering drug metabolism and delaying recovery. Nausea and vomiting are rarely unifactorial and cause considerable discomfort to the patient. There is little evidence to favor one anesthetic or anesthetic technique over another. Nitrous oxide does not appear to increase incidence of nausea in well documented studies. The new serotonin antagonist, odansetron, has been shown in several studies to be superior to other agents as a perioperative antiemetic agent. Perioperative myocardial ischemia is an extremely important complication but difficult to recognize. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that only 10—30% of patients suffering documented myocardial infarction will have pain and that postoperative EKG changes are often nonspecific. One must therefore look for secondary indications of on-going ischemia such as hypotension, arrhythmias, elevated filling pressures, or postoperative oliguria. 290 Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA) is a commonly used technique for postoperative analgesia. The following statement(s) is/are true for the use of PCA. The technique of patient-controlled analgesia is based on investigations that small intravenous bolus doses of narcotic on demand can provide patients with improved pain relief at the same or less total narcotic dose. The system requires some degree of sophistication and a conscious patient who has been instructed in the technique. Numerous studies have demonstrated that PCA is as safe as conventional IM medication. The patient can be restricted from receiving excessive agents via setting a lockout interval duration of several minutes during which time a dose of narcotic cannot be successfully administered. In addition, limits to the total hourly dose can be set. 291 Narcotics are commonly used in the administration of general anesthesia. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true concerning this class of agents. Narcotics and synthetic analogues belong in the class of drugs called opioids. Narcotics produce profound analgesia and respiratory depression. They have no amnesic properties, no myocardial depressive effects, and no muscle relaxant properties. Narcotics may produce significant hemodynamic effects indirectly through the release of histamine and/or blunting of the patient’s sympathetic vascular tone due to analgesic properties. Acutely injured patients may be hypovolemic and in pain, with high sympathetic tone and peripheral resistance. Therefore, such patients can experience a dramatic drop in systemic blood pressure with minimal doses of opioids. All opioids can be reversed with naloxone. Naloxone reversal, however, can be dangerous because the agent acutely reverses not only the analgesic effects of the opioid but also analgesics effects of native opioids. Naloxone treatment has been associated with acute pulmonary edema and myocardial ischemia and should not be used electively to reverse the effects of narcotic. Propofol is a lipid-soluble substitute isopropyl phenol non-narcotic agent that produces rapid induction of anesthesia followed by awakening in four to eight minutes. 292 Anesthetic techniques used in the management of patients with significant pulmonary disease include: Patients with significant pulmonary diseases require special anesthetic techniques. Obstructive pulmonary disease can either be chronic (COPD) or acute (asthma). In either case, the reversible component of obstruction should be reversed prior to elective surgery. In patients with reactive airway disease, the endotracheal tube may induce severe bronchospasm. Even in patients who are well treated preoperatively, reactive bronchospasm may complicate anesthetic induction and emergence from anesthesia. The principal method used to prevent or diminish this “foreign body” induced bronchospasm is intubation of the patient at a deep level of anesthesia when reflexes are blunted. The classic way of managing a patient with severe asthma is to induce with an agent that produces bronchodilatation and to ventilate the patient with an inhalation agent until deeply anesthetized prior to laryngoscopy and intubation. The patient should be extubated while spontaneously ventilating, but with the inhalation agent still in effect, bringing the patient to consciousness while ventilating by mask. Because of the potential adverse effects of systemic narcotics on respiratory drive, the use of epidural narcotics and local anesthetics for postoperative pain control has become very popular. These techniques allow the patient to be extubated earlier, and patients with intrathoracic and upper abdominal surgery, help restore pulmonary function toward preoperative values. Preoperative use of intermittent positive pressure breathing has not been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.",

In general, the presence of a hernia may be considered an adequate indication for hernia repair. Certainly the presence of complications due to hernia necessitates the correction of those complications and usually the repair of the hernia. As with any treatment, the benefits of operative repair must be weighed against the natural history of the disease, the extent to which the treatment can correct the problem, the possibility of treatment-related injury, and the interference of concomitant disease with the treatment results. With a few exceptions, the natural history of an abdominal wall hernia is that the size of the defect and the sac enlarges over time, and this enlargement increases the difficulty of adequate repair and the chances of recurrence of the hernia. The risk of major complications is greater in an individual patient, the longer the exposure to a hernia and the larger the sac relative to the hernia defect. In addition, major complications necessitate an emergent operation with attended high mortality and morbidity relative to that experienced with an elective repair. The use of a truss, an external support device using a system of straps to exert regional pressure over the hernia defect, should generally be avoided. Trusses do not consistently maintain a hernia in the reduced state, and they may put an unreduced hernia in greater jeopardy of strangulation. The pressure exerted induces edema by decreasing lymphatic and venous flow out of the herniated bowel. Trusses may also lead to injury to the skin overlying the hernia.",

          "B",
          "E"
        ],
        "explanation": "Chylous ascites is accumulation within the peritoneal cavity of chyle, a lymphatic fluid with a high lipid content. Access of intestinal lipids to the circulation is via mesenteric lymphatics that enter the cisterna chyle, which in turn becomes the thoracic duct which eventually enters the venous system at the junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins. The cisterna chyli lies at the anterior surface of the first and second lumbar vertebrae slightly to the right of the aorta. Chylous ascites may result from injury to major lymphatic duct or the cisterna. However for lymphatic leakage to persist, widespread occlusion of lymphaticovenous collaterals within the abdomen must be present. Malignancy is the predominant cause (88%) of spontaneous chylous ascites in adults, with lymphoma the most common malignancy. Diagnostic studies must include not only documentation of lymphatic origin of the abdominal fluid but also an attempt to delineate the cause of chylous ascites. Paracentesis and analysis of chylous fluid typically reveals elevated triglycerides, protein, and leukocyte levels, with a predominance of lymphocytes. Unfortunately, cytology is seldom positive despite the presence of malignancy. Lymphangiography may define the site of lymphatic leak for patients in whom the leak is from the cisterna or retroperitoneal lymphatics but not when from the mesenteric or hepatic lymphatics. Of noninvasive studies, CT is the test of choice, with a high diagnostic yield in nontraumatic chylous ascites in adults. Frequently, laparotomy with node biopsy is required for histology and typing in cases suspected to be cancer, particularly for lymphoma. Treatments for chylous ascites have been directed toward decreasing lymph and triglyceride accumulation. Successful resolution of chylous ascites has been achieved using a fat-restricted diet with added medium-chain triglycerides in an attempt to reduce lymphatic transport of triglycerides and perhaps intestinal lymph flow. Although there have been reports of success using such dietary manipulation, many failures have been reported. Therefore, in most patients with chylous ascites, treatment is likely to be successful only when directed toward the underlying cause. For patients with lymphoma, therapy effective against lymphoma is likely to eliminate chylous ascites. The prognosis for patients with chylous ascites is much better in infants and children than in adults, principally because of the differences in causes of the condition. A mortality of 21% is reported in infants and children whereas a mortality of 88% has been noted in adults. Patients with chylous ascites with associated neoplasms typically have the gravest prognosis.",

        "explanation": "Desmoid tumors are fibromatous tumors that may resemble low-grade fibrosarcoma but never metastasize. The tumor often infiltrates adjacent muscle and has a high incidence of recurrence despite seemingly adequate gross resection. The highest frequency is in women of childbearing age of which over 90% of tumors are abdominal in location. For abdominal wall desmoid tumors, approximately one-third are associated with a previous operation at the tumor site. The most frequent presenting symptom is a nontender, palpable abdominal wall mass. Diagnostic imaging is best carried out by CT or MRI, which delineate the extent of involvement of the layers of the abdominal wall and potential intraperitoneal extension. Initial treatment of abdominal wall desmoid tumors is surgical. Because the margins of the tumor are not easily determined and because the tumor often infiltrates muscle and periosteum, limited margins around the gross tumor frequently result in microscopic tumor at the margin. Recurrence rates for abdominal desmoid tumors vary from 9% to 40%, and recurrence is frequent with inadequate margins. A 5-cm margin of resection is considered adequate with mono bloc resection of rib cage, pubic or iliac bone or involved portions of organs such as bladder to achieve these margins. Reconstruction of the abdominal wall with polypropylene mesh is necessary in most cases. In patients in whom adequate margins of resection are achieved, there is no benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. Second and third resections after recurrence have been associated with no higher rate of recurrence than primary resection. Radiotherapy alone has achieved local control in desmoid tumor in as many as 100% of tumors treated primarily and 75% of recurrent tumors. Radiation doses at least 60 Gy are considered necessary for consistent control. The large radiation dose risks major damage to adjacent bowel and therefore primary radiation treatment of abdominal wall desmoid tumors has a limited role.",

The repair involves approximation of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia and the lateral edge of the rectus sheath to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. A femoral hernia cannot be repaired by the Bassini repair because the orifice to the femoral canal lies deep to the inguinal ligament. A Cooper’s ligament repair does approximate the structures to the transversalis fascia of the pectineal (Cooper’s) ligament between the pubic tubercle and the femoral vein and therefore is appropriate for repair of a femoral hernia. A relaxing incision for repairs of direct and large indirect inguinal hernias prevents excessive tension in the closure. There are an increasing number of proponents for the use of prosthetic material for the routine repair of inguinal hernias. Prosthetic material, such as polypropylene mesh, have been used for years for repair of large or recurrent inguinal and femoral hernias. The prosthetic mesh provides a low-tension repair for such large defects which otherwise could not be closed without excessive tension. In addition, the mesh incites the formation of scar tissue to further increase tensile strength beyond that provided by mesh alone. Results reported for inguinal hernia repairs using mesh have been excellent, although there is a slight risk of infection of the prosthetic material which must be considered.",

Although rare, most obturator hernias occur in older multiparous women and are predominantly right-sided. Symptoms are frequently intermittent but tend to be acute and become increasingly severe with incarceration of the hernia. Intestinal symptoms predominate, but dysesthesia or pain in the medial thigh with occasional radiation to the hip is often present. Dysesthesia results from compression of either division of the obturator nerve. Although the hernia is never externally visible, in a small percentage of patients a mass can be palpated in the upper, medial thigh. A correct diagnosis of obturator hernia is made in only about one-third of patients presenting with intestinal obstruction. Plain radiographs are seldom helpful, however a CT scan will usually confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is operative. There is no place for expectant therapy, especially in a patient with pain an parasthesias along the inner aspect of the thigh or with clinical or radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction. Many surgical approaches have been promoted, but the transabdominal approach should be used because it has several advantages. It best confirms the diagnosis and exposes the obturator canal, orifice, vessels, and nerve, also permitting bowel resection when required. The sac is dealt with in a standard fashion. The hernia defect should be repaired, but repair usually requires a polypropylene mesh patch because the margin of the defect cannot be approximated primarily.",

Only about 10% of umbilical hernias in adults are thought to be the result of a congenital defect carried into adulthood. Most adult umbilical hernias are acquired and are called paraumbilical hernias. The paraumbilical hernia typically occurs in a multiparous female. Other patients with increased intraabdominal pressure, particularly with concomitant chronic abdominal distension as from ascites, are also at increased risk for the development of paraumbilical hernias. Umbilical and paraumbilical hernias vary from small to extremely large. Incarceration is frequent in the large hernias, which typically have a small neck. Indications for umbilical hernia repair in adults include symptoms, incarceration, large hernia relative to the neck, and trophic changes in the overlying skin. Among adults with associated ascites, repair is advocated to avoid potentially serious complications. The presence of discoloration or ulceration of overlying skin or a rapid increase in size of the hernia herald impending rupture. Spontaneous rupture of the hernia in these patients can be catastrophic and is frequently associated with mortality rates approaching 30%. By comparison, elective umbilical hernia repair can be performed safely in patients with ascites with acceptable morbidity and mortality.",

Rectus sheath hematomas predominate in women by a ratio of about 3:1. The mean age of incidence is in the late fifth decade. Although spontaneous formation of a rectus hematoma is rare, it can occur with vasculitis, arterial venous malformations, a severe coagulopathy, or with the administration of anticoagulants. The usual cause is trauma. Events as trivial as sneezing, coughing, or twisting to the side have initiated a rectus hematoma. Abdominal pain is almost always described at presentation. Pain is often described as severe and usually is exacerbated by movements that require muscular contraction of the abdominal wall. On examination, there is tenderness over the rectus sheath, voluntary guarding, and often a diffuse mass sensation in the area of tenderness. Contraction of the rectus muscle exacerbates the pain and tenderness. Peritoneal signs are absent. Ecchymosis may occur but usually appears several days after the onset of pain. In cases where the hematoma dissects or originates inferiorly and expands into the prevessicle and preperitoneal space, the hematocrit may fall significantly; however, hemodynamic instability is distinctly unusual. When the intraabdominal source of pain is unknown, ultrasound and particularly computed tomography can delineate the hematoma and localize it to the abdominal wall in almost all cases. Treatment must take into consideration the cause, if known, and whether the hematoma is stable or progressive. Coagulopathy should be corrected when possible. For patients in whom the hematoma is stable, pain medication and avoidance of muscular stress on the abdominal wall are sufficient. For patients with progressive hematoma, the treatment of choice is evacuation of the hematoma from within the rectus sheath and hemostasis, sometimes requiring ligation of the epigastric vessels above and below the hematoma.",

Laboratory studies may be normal in 25% of patients, but 55% of patients will have an elevated blood urea nitrogen. Diagnosis is most commonly suggested by intravenous pyelography. The combination of medial deviation of the ureter, hydroureteronephrosis, and extrinsic ureteral compression are highly suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis. CT scanning or MRI can both define the level of ureteral involvement and depict the mass appearance of the fibrotic process. Exploratory laparotomy with multiple deep biopsies of the retroperitoneal process is an essential part of diagnosis, since foci of carcinoma may be sparse within the predominately sclerotic reaction. Treatment for retroperitoneal fibrosis must identify and deal with potential causative agents, relieve the ureteral obstruction, and reverse the inflammatory-fibrotic process. Renal obstruction may need to be relieved acutely, either by retrograde ureteral stents or by percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. Long-term resolution of ureteral obstruction most frequently has been accomplished by operative freeing of the ureters from the fibrosis and displacing them laterally or within the peritoneal cavity. Although renal function is improved in more than 90% of cases so treated, in as many as one-third of patients, ureteral obstruction recurs on the ipsilateral or contralateral side. Prognosis for patients with nonmalignant retroperitoneal fibrosis is good. Survivals of 86–100% for several years have been reported.",

Patients with an incarcerated hernia may be asymptomatic except for the presence of a bulge. Pain associated with an incarcerated hernia should be interpreted as indicative of strangulation. Many hernias are of such size that they cannot be reduced either spontaneously or manually. If the patient is asymptomatic, elective surgery should be planned. In a patient with pain, attempt at reduction is relatively safe as long as excessive force is not applied. An incarcerated hernia with discomfort or signs of bowel obstruction is best treated with urgent hernia repair, although gentle attempts at reduction may be without consequences. Reduction of a symptomatic hernia may result in reduction of gangrenous bowel into the peritoneal cavity. Reduction of bowel with necrotic areas eventuates in bowel perforation and peritonitis with an associated 10% to 30% mortality and high levels of morbidity. Vigorous attempts at reduction may result in reduction en masse, in which the viscera remain within the peritoneal sac after reduction with the entire sac and its contained viscera forced through the abdominal wall defect into the preperitoneal layer. Reduction en masse usually occurs when a small fibrous neck traps enclosed viscera and is associated with a high risk of continued entrapment and progression to obstruction or strangulation. World-wide hernias are the leading cause of intestinal obstruction. The obstruction is almost exclusively small intestinal with only rarely the colon as the site of obstruction.",

Failure to recognize underlying pathology contributing to symptoms of abdominal straining may both increase the risk of recurrent hernia as well as miss significant existing pathology. A chronic cough from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be investigated and attempts made to control symptoms. Significant obstructive uropathy may warrant urologic consultation and treatment prior to hernia repair. Such treatment is important both to prevent postoperative urinary retention, as well as persistent straining on the newly-completed repair. Change in bowel habits with constipation or the presence of blood associated with bowel movements may suggest a rectal or left-sided colon cancer. Patients frequently relate a specific episode of muscular straining during which a sudden discomfort occurs followed by hernia symptoms of discomfort or a bulge.

First, incisional hernias are often related to a postoperative wound infection, in which case associated fascitis or muscle necrosis may result in loss of tissue. Second, a previous abdominal wall closure under tension or with a technique that resulted in tension on particular sutures may lead to a multifenestrated region of the musculoaponeurotic abdominal wall near or slightly back from its margin. Third, chronic retraction of the abdominal wall muscles result in a larger defect. Fourth, a large potential space remains anterior to the abdominal wall closure in the subcutaneous area; postoperative fluid accumulation in this space contributes to the wound infection rate of 5%. Any such potential space should have operatively placed drains. The key to successful repair involves sufficient dissection and exposure of the true musculoaponeurotic edge and exclusion of adjacent musculoaponeurotic defects and avoidance of closing the wound under tension. Large defects greater than 3 to 4 cm in diameter are seldom able to be closed without excessive tension. The use of relaxing incisions decreases tension and may be particularly useful in midline hernias and therefore may avoid the need for prosthetic mesh.",

For hernias for which inguinal floor reconstruction is required (all direct and moderate to large indirect inguinal hernias, all femoral hernias), simultaneous repair of bilateral hernia results in recurrence of one or both of the hernias twice as frequently as if the hernias were repaired sequentially. Repair of recurrent inguinal or much less commonly femoral hernias can be repaired via an anterior approach particularly at the time of first recurrence in most cases. If a deficit of aponeurotic tissue exists, methods such as polypropylene mesh as an overlay or preferably as an underlay, and tailored around the spermatic cord have proved highly successful. The preperitoneal approach also has potential benefits especially in cases of multiple recurrence where the technique allows avoidance of the inevitable scar encountered with the anterior approach, excellent assessment of the defect, and the ease for placement of synthetic mesh. The Bassini and Shouldice repairs involve approximation of the medial tissues of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia to the inguinal ligament. These techniques cannot be used to repair a femoral hernia because the femoral canal lies deep to the inguinal ligament. Either the anterior approach of McVay (Cooper’s ligament repair) or a preperitoneal approach is preferred for femoral hernias. In patients with bowel obstruction attributed to a hernia, the primary operative approach is on the hernia. Assessment of bowel viability is possible without laparotomy in most cases, and release of adhesions holding the bowel within the sac is more easily accomplished through direct entry into the hernia sac. Reduction of the herniated and incarcerated bowel may be difficult from the intraabdominal approach necessitating a counter incision over the external presentation of the hernia.",

Ascites occurs when either the secretion rate increases or the absorption rate decreases disproportionately. Accumulation of lymph in the peritoneal cavity usually results from trauma or tumor involving lymphatic structures. Proposed treatment regimens range from salt restriction and diuretics to surgical ligation and peritoneovenous shunting. Uninfected bile is a mild irritant to the peritoneal cavity and causes increased production of peritoneal fluid, resulting in bile ascities or choleperitoneum. Most cases of choleperitoneum follow biliary tract surgery, but cases of spontaneous bile duct perforation have been reported in infants and some adults. The most common cause of hemoperitoneum is trauma to the liver or spleen. Less common causes include ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and other intra-abdominal injuries.",

For example, almost all abdominal organs are insensitive to pinching, burning, stabbing, cutting, and electrical and thermal stimulation. The same is true for the application of acid and alkali to normal mucosa. The general classes of visceral stimulation that result in abdominal pain include: (1) stretching and contraction; (2) traction, compression, and torsion; (3) stretch alone; and (4) certain chemicals. Mediating receptors for these responses are located intramurally in hollow organs, on serosal structures such as the visceral peritoneum and capsule of solid organs, within the mesentery and the mucosa. These receptors are polymodal, or responsive to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimulation. Visceral pain almost always heralds intra-abdominal disease but may not indicate the need for surgical therapy. When visceral pain is superceded by somatic pain, the need for surgical intervation becomes likely.",

The visceral layer, i.e., the layer surrounding all intraabdominal organs, is supplied by autonomic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and the parietal peritoneum is supplied by somatic innervation (spinal nerves). The pathways relaying the sensation of pain differ for each layer and differ in quality as well. Visceral pain is characteristically dull, crampy, deep, aching and may involve sweating and nausea. Parietal pain is sharp, severe and persistent. Visceral organs have very little pain sensation, but stretching of the mesentery and stimulation of the parietal peritoneum cause severe pain. Normal embryologic development of the abdominal viscera proceeds with bilateral midline autonomic innervation that results in visceral pain usually being perceived as arising from the midline. Epigastric pain is typical of foregut origin. Periumbilical pain signifies pain emanating from the midgut. Hypogastric or lower abdominal midline pain indicates a hindgut origin.",

        "explanation": "Carcinoids represent two-thirds of all appendiceal neoplasms. Nearly half of all GI carcinoids arise in the appendix at a mean age of 41 years. Two-thirds of the time the carcinoid is only incidentally detected, only 0.5% have evidence of distant metastatic spread at resection. In one experience, carcinoids between 1.5 and 2.0 cm have had minimal metastatic potential and those smaller than 1.5 cm never metastasized. In the 1% that are larger than 2 cm however, metastases are frequent and 80% recur even after resection at this size. Adenocarcinoma of the appendix is exceedingly rare. These tumors occur in elderly patients at the base of the appendix. Appendicitis often follows and the diagnosis is not made preoperatively and is rarely considered during surgery since the appearance of the tumor may mimic perforated appendicitis. Up to half the patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis and the peritoneum is the most common site of spread. Survival is proportional to tumor stage. Dukes’ Stage A disease may be treated simply with appendectomy if all disease can be removed with reasonable margins. Dukes’ B and C lesions require formal right hemicolectomy for disease control. Survival is, stage for stage, similar to colon cancer after 5 years. Appendiceal adenocarcinomas also appear to have an association with secondary tumors, often of the GI tract, in up to 35% of patients. Patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix typically are symptomatic, and wide resection of the primary disease, together with debulking of peritoneal implants, is indicated. Indolent progression of metastases commonly results in prolonged survival rates (50% at 5 years) during which patients may require repeated laparatomies for complications of the disease.",

Urea reaching the colon via either the ileal effluent or the mucosal circulation is split by bacterial ureases. The reabsorbed ammonia is returned to the liver, where it is used for amino acid and protein synthesis. Fermentation is the anaerobic process by which bacteria can degrade carbohydrates and proteins. The normal substrate for colonic fermentation is dietary fiber, which resists degradation by alpha-amylases in the small intestine. Starch polysaccharides are normally degraded by amylases and absorbed in the small intestine; however, when starch polysaccharides are not adequately degraded and absorbed, they can also be fermented and the caloric value recovered as short-chain fatty acids. n-Butyrate, one of the short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation, is the preferred fuel of the colonic epithelium. The colonic epithelium utilizes n-butyrate as a fuel for the absorption of sodium and water. Insoluble fibers retain water and are poorly fermented by bacteria, thus producing fecal bulk.",

A third type of contraction, called mass peristalsis, occurs at varying intervals through the entire colon's length.

The biposy specimen is examined for ganglion cells, but a much more reliable method is staining acetylcholinesterase, which has an accuracy rate of 99%. Cinedefecography involves instilling contrast medium into the rectum and recording the act of defecation with static radiographs and videofluoroscopy videotape. While the static radiographs allow measurement of the anorectal angle and the relationship between the anus and the coccyx/pubis plane, the videotape is used to detect rectal intussusception, which can be missed in static radiographs. In equivocal cases differentiation between malabsorptive and secretory diarrhea can be made by measurement of electrolytes and osmolality in stool. The osmotic gap is calculated by subtracting 2 × (Na + K) from the measured osmolality. A negative osmotic gap is indicative of secretory diarrhea, whereas a positive osmotic gap indicates malabsorptive diarrhea. In a colonic transit study, 20 radiopaque barium-impregnated markers are ingested before breakfast and plain films of the abdomen are obtained on days 4 and 6. The value of CEA is controversial, but most surgeons agree that it is helpful in monitoring following resection for colon cancer.",

Anorectal manometry is particularly useful in patients with fecal incontinence since it can differentiate between segmental and global defects of the anal sphincter. Electromyography records the action potential derived from the different muscles involved in defecation through endoscopically placed mucosal electrodes along the colon. Electromyography can demonstrate persistent contraction of the pubis rectalis muscle during defecation, which is diagnostic of paradoxical pelvic floor contraction.

While p53 and other tumor suppressor genes may be associated with the adenoma-to-carcinoma transition, it appears likely that multiple genetic defects are involved in this transformation. Alterations in p53 appear to be among the last, as changes are uncommon in adenomas but very common in carcinomas.

In the past, subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was accepted as a compromise operation, with the knowledge that disease-bearing rectal tissue was retained. Because other definitive alternatives are currently available, ileorectal anastomosis is no longer appropriate for elective surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis. In an acutely ill patient or when the diagnosis is in question, subtotal colectomy with ileostomy and Hartmann closure of the rectum is the most expeditious choice and allows later restorative surgery.

Typically it manifests clinically with the onset of abdominal pain and severe diarrhea, followed by abdominal distention and generalized tenderness. Once megacolon and toxicity develop, fever, leukocytosis, pallor, tachycardia, lethargy, and shock set in. The initial treatment for toxic megacolon thus includes intravenous fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, nasogastric suction, broad-spectrum antibiotics to provide anaerobic and aerobic gram-negative coverage, and total parenteral nutrition to improve nutritional status. Large intravenous doses of corticosteroids are generally administered to treat the colitis. In addition, many patients with toxic megacolon are already receiving steroid therapy and, so, need stress doses of steroids to prevent adrenal crisis. The immunosuppressive drugs 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine may play a role in the management of refractory ulcerative colitis; however, these drugs are not indicated in the acute management of toxicity. Cyclosporine was shown to be effective in treating acute refractory ulcerative colitis in a single controlled trial, but this has not yet been confirmed by other prospective studies, and it remains a potentially dangerous drug. Opioid antidiarrheals should be avoided since they may exacerbate the colonic dilatation and increase the possibility of perforation. Limited proctoscopy may be helpful in determining the cause of the attack, but colonoscopy may be dangerous and is contraindicated in the face of acute toxic megacolon. If toxic colitis, with or without megacolon, does not improve within 48 hours, emergency surgery is warranted.",

Patients with ulcerative colitis are candidates for colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis, whereas Crohn's disease is a clear contraindication to this operation. Clinical findings suggestive of Crohn's disease include anal fistula or other perianal disease, though it must be kept in mind that approximately 10% of patients with ulcerative colitis may also develop perianal problems secondary to their chronic diarrhea. Endoscopic or radiographic evidence of rectal sparing is powerful evidence against a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. However, if patients have been treated with steroid or salicylate enemas, they may have less active disease in the rectum than in the more proximal colon, a finding that could mislead the clinician about the presence or degree of rectal involvement. The deep linear ulcers that lead to a cobblestone appearance on barium enema are strongly suggestive of Crohn's disease. Typically, ulcerative colitis is confined to the rectum and colon. Frank small bowel involvement is suggestive of Crohn's disease; however, patients with active pancolitis may have secondary inflammation of the ileum, which has been called backwash ileitis. This clears after colectomy. The differential diagnosis may ultimately rely on histologic evaluation. Endoscopic biopsies are not generally useful since they only sample 3-mm. deep segments of mucosa and submucosa. Transmural inflammation and granulomas on surgical pathologic specimens are pathognomonic of Crohn's disease.",

The majority of patients with colonic volvulus are elderly men with underlying neurologic dysfunction. They are commonly referred from a chronic care facility. The patient's condition should be assessed immediately. In the absence of peritonitis the preferred initial management consists of urgent endoscopic detorsion of the volvulus. In most patients this can be easily accomplished with a rigid 25-cm. sigmoidoscope or a flexible fiberoptic colonoscope. Often detorsion of the sigmoid colon results in a dramatic expulsion of gas and feces. A rectal tube should be introduced into the sigmoid and then taped to the thigh or buttock and left in place to prevent immediate recurrence of the volvulus.",

The distal transverse colon and the descending colon obtain their blood supply from the left colic branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, while the sigmoid colon obtains its blood supply from sigmoidal branches.

Between 500 and 1500 g of a semiliquid material enter the colon on a daily basis. Most of this substance is absorbed, yielding a stool output that weighs about 200 g. The reason for this efficient absorptive capacity, despite the relative impermeability of the colonic epithelium, relates to the close interrelation between epithelial transport and colonic motor activity. Transit through the large bowel takes about 10 times as long as that through the small intestine, usually requiring 2 or 3 days. Such slow passage provides optimal opportunity for the luminal contents to come into surface contact with the absorptive epithelium. Thus, sodium and water, which are extracted against high electrochemical and osmotic gradients, are efficiently absorbed. Further, the relatively static conditions of the colon allow the proliferation of vast numbers of anaerobic bacteria, which in turn break down carbohydrate to volatile fatty acids, which then are rapidly absorbed. The more rapid the colonic transit, the less efficient are these absorptive processes.",

Acute pseudo-obstruction usually involves the proximal colon, but may extend throughout the transverse colon and, rarely, the descending colon as well. The cause of this syndrome is unknown, but it almost always arises in critically ill or bedridden patients who have serious concomitant disease. The syndrome is occasionally seen in traumatized patients, particularly if a vertebral fracture is present. The hallmark of the disease is severe abdominal distention. Roentgenographic films of the abdomen show marked gaseous distention of the colon that is typically localized to the right colon. The major problem with Ogilvie’s syndrome is the risk of cecal perforation. This risk is substantial, and the more prolonged the cecal distention, the greater this risk becomes. Although a considerable debate exists in the literature about the extent to which cecal dilatation can occur before perforation becomes a likely possibility, some type of decompressive procedure should be considered when the cecum reaches 10–12 cm in diameter. Fiberoptic colonoscopy is the treatment of choice and is initially successful in 90% or more of patients.

Abnormalities within the neural elements of the myenteric plexus suggest that disturbances in neuromodulation of colonic motility may play a role in some patients. The treatment of colonic inertia has proved difficult and many patients have required subtotal colectomy to correct the severe constipation. Diagnosis of this condition is usually achieved by assessing colonic transit with various radio-opaque markers. After ingestion of such markers, sequential abdominal films are taken to assess movement of markers in each segment of the colon. Total transit time in normal subjects averages about 35 hours.

The submucosal plexus is located between the muscularis mucosa and the circular muscle layer of the muscularis propria. Sandwiched between the circular muscle and the outer longitudinal muscle is the myenteric plexus. The myenteric plexus appears to be intimately involved with colonic motility. The plexus is composed of ganglia and clusters of nerve cell bodies that are linked together by bundles of nerve processes. Although the myenteric plexus is well developed throughout the entire length of the colon, the density of nerve cells is greatest in the proximal one third of the colon, similar to the density that exists throughout the small intestine. The physiologic significance of this organization remains to be defined, but probably contributes to the different motility patters that exist throughout the large bowel.",

The therapeutic role of intravenous steroids in toxic megacolon is controversial. Most patients presenting with a severe attack of ulcerative colitis are already receiving steroid therapy and require stress doses of corticosteroids to prevent adrenal crisis. When symptomatology is progressive or when there is evidence of colonic perforation, emergency surgery is indicated. Postoperative complications including sepsis, wound infection, intraperitoneal abscess, fistula formation, and delayed wound healing are common and have been reported in up to 50% of patients. The presence of colonic perforation doubles operative risk. In the presence of toxic megacolon or colonic perforation, the operation should be definitive without being overly aggressive.

A positive test indicates mucosal inflammation and excludes the benign form of antibiotic diarrhea; however, no more than a third of patients with C difficile colitis have positive fecal leukocyte tests. The isolation of C difficile from stools of a patient with diarrhea does not by itself prove the patient has colitis caused by C difficile, because about 25% of isolates of C difficile obtained from humans are nontoxigenic and nonpathogenic. In addition, at least 3% of healthy adults are asymptomatic carriers off toxigenic isolates of C difficile.

C difficile isolates are almost always susceptible to vancomycin at concentrations of lower than 5 mg/l, and few isolates have been identified that require more than 16 mg/l. Because vancomycin is poorly absorbed into the systemic circulation when given orally at a dosage of 125 to 500 mg four times per day, concentrations far exceeding 16 mg/l, the maximum concentration required for inhibition of C difficile, are easily achieved in stools. Even patients with profuse diarrhea achieve adequate concentrations of vancomycin in stools with these regimens.

These chromosomal regions have been hypothesized to contain tumor-suppressor genes whose products normally regulate growth and differentiation in a negative fashion. One such gene linked to familial adenomatous polyposis was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5q and referred to as the APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli) gene. The gene codes for a 300 kilodalton protein which has recently been shown to bind to b-catenin, implying an important role in cell adhesion and possibly cytoskeleton function. It is hypothesized that disruption of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton function can lead to loss of contact inhibition which may promote neoplastic transformation as well as invasiveness of cancer cells. Another tumor suppressor gene thought to be important in colorectal tumorigenesis is the p53 gene located in chromosome 17p. Alteration in p53 is one of the most common genetic events seen in human malignancies. The p53 gene produces a DNA-binding phosphoprotein that is important in cell proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. Allelic loss of p53 has been observed in more than 75% of colorectal carcinomas. Another common genetic alteration associated with colorectal tumors is an allelic loss of chromosome 18q. This is where the \"deleted in colorectal carcinoma\" gene, also termed DCC is located. Mutations in DCC are present in 47% of late adenomas and 73% of carcinomas. The DCC protein shares significant homology with the neural cell adhesion molecule family that regulates cell adhesion and recognition.",

CEA is an oncofetal antigen because it is also expressed by early embryonic or fetal cells. It is now known that CEA is not tumor-specific since it can be elevated by a variety of malignancies from different sites as well as in some benign conditions. CEA is not useful as a screening or diagnostic test but is useful as a tumor marker. CEA is elevated in over 90% of patients with disseminated colorectal cancer and in about 20% of patients with localized disease. Serum levels generally are elevated in proportion to the mass of the tumor present and often correlate with response to therapy. CEA levels are useful when elevated levels fall to normal levels after curative resection. In about two thirds of patients with recurrent disease, an increased CEA level is the first indicator of the tumor, and serial CEA testing, combined with regular physical examinations, is one of the most useful tests for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer.",

The ras protooncogenes are a family of normal genes (N-ras, H-ras and K-ras) that are highly conserved in nature and encode for the production of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) which are important for signal transduction. G proteins are involved in the transduction of proliferative signals induced by growth factors or factors involved in cell differentiation. The product of a mutated ras gene is an abnormal G protein which has lost its ability to become inactivated; and thus, results in continuous growth stimulation and autonomous cell growth or differentiation. Experimentally, transfection of normal fibroblasts by mutated ras genes confer neoplastic properties to those cells. About half of colorectal carcinomas and a similar percentage of adenomas larger than 1 cm in diameter have been found to have the ras gene mutations. By contrast, less than 10% of patients with adenomas smaller than 1 cm have this mutation. It has been postulated that the ras gene mutation may be the initiating event in some colorectal carcinomas or, alternatively, may promote the clonal expansion of a mutated cell population. It appears that the ras gene mutation alone is not responsible for tumorigenesis. Other molecular events appear to be required in addition to ras gene mutations.",

The most common type is tubular adenoma, or adenomatous polyp, which constitutes about 75% of neoplastic polyps. Tubulovillous adenomas represent 15% and pure villous adenomas 10% of neoplastic polyps. All adenomas contain some degree of dysplasia or cellular atypia. This dysplasia can be graded from mild to severe. Carcinoma in situ and severe dysplasia have been grouped together under the classification of high-grade dysplasia. In carcinoma in situ, there is no invasion into the muscularis mucosa, as there is in invasive carcinoma. The incidence of invasive malignancy differs markedly for the three types of adenomas and increases with size. In general, malignancies are seen in 5% of adenomatous polyps, in 22% of tubulovillous adenomas, and in 40% of villous lesions.

A dilemma in treating colonic polyps occurs when a resected lesion contains a malignant focus. A decision must then be made about the need for a colectomy. If the lesion does not penetrate the muscularis mucosa, it should be considered an in situ malignancy that does not have the propensity to metastasize and, therefore, does not require further surgery. If the lesion penetrates the muscularis mucosa, it is an invasive cancer and may require surgery. In selected cases of pedunculated polyps, conservative management without colectomy may be undertaken if the lesion does not contain poorly differentiated tumor cells or evidence of vascular invasion and if a negative resection margin has been obtained at the level of the stalk. Lesions that are poorly differentiated or have evidence of vascular invasion, regardless of a negative surgical margin, should be treated by colectomy.",

From these studies, fat intake has been the most consistently positive association and fiber intake the most consistently inverse association noted in the incidence of colorectal cancer. In comparisons between countries, the rates of colon cancer are strongly associated with the intake of animal fat and meat. The associations between per capita consumption of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol and national incidence rates of colon cancer are strongly positive. The proposed mechanism by which dietary fat may increase the risk of developing colonic cancer is by its interaction with bile acids. The relation between fiber intake and colon cancer was initially noted by Burkitt, who reported low rates of colon cancer in areas of Africa where fiber consumption and stool bulk were high. In general, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that fiber intake is higher in non-western countries with lower incidence of colon cancer. The role of fiber was originally seen simply as providing bulk to dilute potential carcinogens and speed their transit through the colon. This appears to be an oversimplification and the relation between fiber intake and colon cancer is more complex. Additional studies have suggested that certain fibers may bind mutagens, which reduces their contact with colonic epithelium, may favorably change the fecal pH, and may participate in other complex interactions.",

The proximal margin of resection should include the entire segment of thickened, contracted colon and any additional colon that is involved in the acute inflammation. If the fistulous opening is not identifiable, implying that it is small in diameter, nothing needs to be done to identify the bladder fistula. Urinary catheter drainage for 7 to 10 days, followed by cystographic verification of closure of the fistula, is sufficient therapy. Depending on the severity of the related complications of diverticulitis (obstruction, inflammation, abscess, sepsis, other fistulas), it may occasionally be necessary to perform a two-stage procedure, the first stage being segmental colectomy and colostomy formation and the second stage consisting of closure of the colostomy. Either the one-or two-stage procedure can be done with low morbidity and mortality and with less than a 5% recurrence rate.",

Most patients with an acute episode of diverticulitis can be treated with intravenous fluids, bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and analgesics. If the patient does not improve within 48 hours, complications of diverticulitis may exist, and further investigation is necessary. Only about 20% of patients develop complications of diverticulitis with their first episode; this rises to 60% with recurrent episodes. Although a water-soluble contrast enema radiograph can provide the diagnosis of diverticulitis, computed tomography (CT) has become the preferred diagnostic test in patients that do not improve within 48 hours. CT is especially useful in delineating the complications of diverticulitis, including perforation and abscess formation. In addition, at the time of CT scan, percutaneous drainage catheters can be placed if an abscess is identified. After CT drainage of an abscess, 50% to 90% of patients may undergo a successful one stage procedure of segmented colectomy and primary anastomosis. If percutaneous drainage is not feasible, or an abscess is not identified, surgical intervention is recommended.",

This powerful muscle exists in a continuously tonic state, and is responsible for maintaining closure of the resting anal canal. The high-pressure zone of the anal canal at rest is due to the actions of the internal sphincter. The external sphincter contributes to anal pressure only when a bolus of stool is present within the anal canal. The increase in pressure during voluntary contraction (squeeze pressure) is exclusively due to the activity of the external sphincter. The high resting pressure in the anal canal acts as a barrier to prevent leakage of mucus and gas. When the rectum is distended, the internal sphincter relaxes. This relaxation allows the rectal content to move down to the anal canal. In contrast, when the rectum is distended, the external sphincter contracts. Reflex contraction of the external sphincter prevents rectal content from leaking through the anus. Although volitional contraction of the external sphincter can only be sustained for short periods, it is the most important mechanism of voluntary continence.",

When external sphincter transection appears likely, some authors recommend the use of a seton. A seton is a suture that is drawn through a fistula. The rationale for using a seton is to create fibrosis. The seton is threaded through the fistulous track and tied over the muscles. In the second stage (average interval, 6 to 8 weeks), fistulotomy is performed. Incontinence after the proper use of seton is uncommon, even when the fistula is deep.",

The cause of diarrhea in patients with cirrhosis is unknown, but malabsorption secondary to splanchnic venous hypertension may be a contributing factor.

Such is the case in alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. When the site of increased resistance is at the presinusoidal level, either within (schistosomiasis) or outside (portal vein thrombosis) the liver, the hepatic venous wedge pressure is normal despite markedly elevated portal vein pressure. Although schistosomiasis is one of the more frequent causes of portal hypertension worldwide, in North America presinusoidal portal hypertension is considerably less common than alcoholic liver disease. A normal hepatic venous wedge pressure in a patient who has bled from varices should lead one to suspect a presinusoidal cause.

Although extensive esophagogastric devascularization has effectively prevented recurrent bleeding in Japanese series, these operations have been followed by rebleeding rates in excess of 25% in most Western series. Although one controlled trial has shown more frequent recurrent hemorrhage following the distal splenorenal shunt than after the portacaval shunt, most series have reported rebleeding rates of less than 10% for both of these operations. Both the liver and the splanchnic viscera are important sites of ascites formation. Since the distal splenorenal shunt maintains sinusoidal and mesenteric venous hypertension and requires interruption of important retroperitoneal lymphatics, it tends to aggravate rather than relieve ascites. Hepatic sinusoidal pressure may be unchanged or even increased after an end-to-side portacaval shunt. Only side-to-side portal-systemic shunts, such as the side-to-side portacaval shunt, reliably decompress both the liver and splanchnic viscera, thus preventing ascites formation.",

The distal splenorenal shunt is a selective shunt that preserves hepatic portal perfusion in the majority of patients; however, the magnitude of portal flow is decreased because the gastrosplenic component is diverted into the renal vein. Additionally, many patients (especially alcoholic cirrhotics) develop collaterals between the mesenteric venous circulation and the shunt, resulting in gradual attrition of the remaining portal flow. Although there have been anecdotal reports of portal vein thrombosis after endoscopic sclerotherapy, two controlled trials have demonstrated better preservation of hepatic portal perfusion in sclerotherapy patients than in persons who receive the distal splenorenal shunt.",

Unfortunately, splenectomy is sometimes done for clinically insignificant hypersplenism, thus obviating a distal splenorenal shunt if the patient should subsequently bleed from varices. The initial treatment for most patients with bleeding esophageal varices should be endoscopic sclerotherapy; however, operation is required for the approximately one third of patients who fail sclerotherapy and for noncompliant persons, those living in remote geographic locations, and patients bleeding from gastric varices. Ascites can be controlled by a medical regimen of dietary salt restriction and diuretic therapy in more than 95% of patients. When ascites is intractable to medical management, either intermittent large-volume paracenteses or a surgical peritoneovenous shunt should be done. With rare exceptions, encephalopathy should be treated medically. Most important is elimination of any precipitating factors that led to the neuropsychological disturbance.

Oliguria is common in the first 24 hours after shunt insertion. A correctly placed PVS (patency confirmed using an intraoperative “shuntogram”) expands the intravascular volume with a continuous reinfusion of ascites. Inspection should identify elevation of the jugular venous pressure, and a diuretic (usually furosemide) is needed. The mechanisms of action of the two shunts are very different.

HBV infection is required for infection with HDV and is therefore an essential step toward, rather than preventive of, HBV infection.",

These stones tend to consist predominantly of cholesterol (about 80% of gallbladder stones are predominantly cholesterol). Stones found in the bile ducts after cholecystectomy may have been overlooked, but de novo stone formation does occur. Arbitrarily, stones found 2 years after cholecystectomy are assumed to have formed within the duct system. Calcium bilirubinate stones are thought to result from precipitation of insoluble bilirubin monoglucuronide formed by deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide, a reaction promoted by the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is produced by bacteria in the biliary tract. Calcium bilirubinate stones are found almost exclusively in patients who have some form of biliary tract lesion that causes partial obstruction, and these patients tend to have bactibilia. Stones smaller than approximately 5 mm. often can be extracted through a dilated cystic duct or pushed into the duodenum. Larger stones are best left for postoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy and extraction. Patients with more than five stones or stones larger than 1.5 cm. should be treated by open choledocholithotomy or, when indicated, a biliary-enteric anastomosis. Not all patients with symptomatic common duct stones have elevated serum bilirubin, but when jaundice is present the bilirubin is only rarely greater than 15 mg. per dl.",

Therefore, all biliary strictures should be treated unless this is not possible or there is no chance for success. The presence or absence of jaundice is of no significance. Often, the only biochemical abnormality is mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase. The long-term results of percutaneous balloon dilatation are not yet known, but short-term results are good. Although some argue that balloon dilatation should be the initial treatment, its role is ill-defined, and it should not be viewed as standard therapy at this time. Biliary-enteric anastomoses are predisposed to stricture, for reasons that are ill-understood. A mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis, large size of the anastomosis, a normal duct at the point of anastomosis, and stenting appear to be elements that work against stricture. About 70% of anastomoses are not complicated by strictures. Common duct strictures caused by chronic pancreatitis are located in the distal portion of the duct and are easily treated by side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy. A wide anastomosis is usually possible, and because of this stenting often is not necessary.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Cholangiography is essential for both diagnosis and evaluation of resectability. Brushings of the lesion for diagnosis and temporary stenting, done percutaneously or endoscopically, are often done at the time of cholangiography. Angiography and CT are helpful, but in the absence of hepatic artery or portal vein occlusion these tests are not accurate predictors of resectability. The primary obstacles to complete resection are invasion of the portal vein or the hepatic artery and proximal extension of the tumor into the liver. The long-range prognosis for patients who undergo treatment for extrahepatic bile duct cancer is poor, even when the lesion is surgically resectable and adjuvant therapy is given. Only about 10% of patients are alive without disease at 10 years. Nevertheless, bile duct cancer tends not to metastasize to distant sites, so resection and radiation therapy are useful in prolonging symptom-free life. Tumors in the proximal third of the extrahepatic bile duct system are treated by a Roux-en-Y biliary-enteric anastomosis. To ensure excision of the entire tumor this anastomosis usually must be made to the individual hepatic ducts, which must be stented individually. Tumors of the middle third usually require anastomosis to the proximal hepatic duct. In contrast, lesions of the distal third require Whipple's procedure with appropriate reconstruction. Thus, the treatment of extrahepatic bile duct cancer depends on the location of the tumor. Pain is not a prominent feature of bile duct cancer. Most cases become manifest by the insidious development of jaundice.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: In the past, choledochal cyst was treated by Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy, but long-term results were poor. Excision of the cyst is essential to prevent recurrent pancreatitis. In addition, the development of carcinoma in about 25% of patients mandates cyst excision. Accordingly, excision of the cyst with biliary reconstruction by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and diversion of the flow of pancreatic juice through the ampulla of Vater is currently the standard treatment. Sclerosing cholangitis causes fibrosis of bile ducts both within and outside the liver. This process, which is poorly understood, causes strictures in the duct system, characteristically with normal or dilated segments between strictures. Unfortunately, this anatomic arrangement does not lend itself to biliary reconstructive procedures. Each case must be analyzed, however, because in some patients the anatomic situation may lend itself to balloon dilatation or reconstruction. When the gallbladder appears to be absent, a search should be made for an ectopically located organ in the retroduodenal area, within the falciform ligament, and within the substance of the right lobe of the liver. With true gallbladder agenesis the common duct may be dilated, and choledocholithiasis is present in about one fourth of those who undergo operation. Therefore, operative needle cholangiography should always be done. Dissection of a long, fused cystic duct is fraught with hazard because the cystic and common ducts may share a common wall and serious duct damage may occur. The cystic duct should be ligated and divided immediately proximal to the area of fusion.",

Chronic cholecystitis associated with cholelithiasis may develop in the absence of pain, and in critically ill patients pain may not be a prominent feature of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Only about 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis are jaundiced. Although an occasional patient may have concomitant bile duct obstruction, the jaundice associated with acute cholecystitis is probably due to absorption of bile pigments from the diseased gallbladder. The presence of jaundice in a patient with right-side upper quadrant pain should also suggest the possibility of acute cholangitis secondary to bile duct obstruction. Ultrasonography is very accurate in the detection of gallstones, but stones may be present in the absence of acute cholecystitis. Thickening of the gallbladder wall and a collection of fluid around the gallbladder are ultrasonographic findings in some patients with acute cholecystitis, but they are not always present and are not specific. Ultrasonography may be useful when the diagnosis is obscure because other conditions in the liver, pancreas, and kidney can be detected; however, it is not the definitive test for acute cholecystitis. Cholescintigraphy is specific for the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis (accuracy over 95% in experienced hands). The rapidity, simplicity, and accuracy make cholescintigraphy the definitive diagnostic test in acute calculous cholecystitis; however, it must be interpreted cautiously in the context of another critical illness or recent surgery or trauma, because false-positives are not unusual in these situations.",

A majority of cases occur after trauma, burns, or major surgical procedures performed for other conditions. The precise pathogenesis has not been determined. The diagnosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis is often difficult because symptoms may be masked by another illness, injury, or the postoperative state. Unlike acute calculous cholecystitis, in which pain is always present, pain occurs in only about 70% of cases. In addition, cholescintigraphy is sometimes inaccurate. These factors make the diagnosis difficult, and a high index of suspicion is necessary, especially in patients who have had operations or trauma. Unexplained abdominal pain, sepsis, and ileus should prompt a thorough investigation. The mortality rate for acute acalculous cholecystitis is higher than that of the calculous type. The incidence of gangrene and perforation of the gallbladder is higher. The accompanying illnesses and conditions and the frequent delays in diagnosis undoubtedly contribute to the higher death rate. Percutaneous cholecystostomy has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver in patients who are thought to have acute acalculous cholecystitis. Aspiration and culture of bile assist in confirming the diagnosis, and continuous drainage successfully treats the acute condition. Surprisingly, persistent gangrene and subsequent complications have been infrequent. Immediate cholecystectomy should be done if significant improvement does not take place within 12 hours of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Long-term management of the tube and the need for elective cholecystectomy must be individualized. The experience with percutaneous cholecystostomy is too small to determine whether this technique reduces the mortality rate.",

However, patients who have one or more significant risk factors such as a recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, clinically significant coronary artery disease, or cirrhosis should not have immediate cholecystectomy unless they do not improve within 24 to 36 hours in response to antibiotic administration and supportive care. Antibiotic administration should commence as soon as the diagnosis is made and should be continued for 24 hours postoperatively—or for 7 days if significant peritonitis is present. This use of antibiotics has significantly reduced septic complications after cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. In most cases the gallbladder is tensely distended, making visualization and dissection of the cystic duct area difficult and perhaps dangerous. Decompression of the gallbladder by insertion of a needle facilitates retraction and dissection of the gallbladder. Although some advise that operative cholangiography be done only on a selective basis, its routine use helps to delineate anatomy and facilitates detection of an occasionally unsuspected bile duct stone. Accordingly, it is used routinely in elective cases. In acute cholecystitis, however, the biliary duct system may be very friable, and operative cholangiography should be done only when it is safe to do so.",

The risk of the development of symptoms in patients who have asymptomatic stones is approximately 2% per year, a rate associated with mortality and morbidity that do not exceed those of elective cholecystectomy. Therefore, cholecystectomy is not indicated for asymptomatic patients.

The best evidence is that the bile duct injury rate (0.4%) is approximately double that for open cholecystectomy. The incidence of this serious complication will probably decrease with improved techniques, better training, and more advanced instrumentation. Only symptomatic patients should have cholecystectomy. Prophylactic removal of the gallbladder is not cost effective. All elective operations are contraindicated in the first trimester, so as to prevent fetal anomalies and spontaneous abortion. The laparoscopic technique is not contraindicated thereafter except in patients in whom peritoneal access cannot safely be established. This is rarely a problem.

Fever is the most common symptom; therefore, cholangitis should be considered in all patients who have unexplained fever. Episodes of pain, chills, and fever are often so brief as not to concern the patient. Cholangitis does not occur in the absence of partial or complete bile duct obstruction. All patients diagnosed as having cholangitis should have appropriate diagnostic studies to determine the cause. This usually involves cholangiography. The presence of bacteria in bile does not produce symptoms in the absence of partial or complete obstruction of the bile duct system. When obstruction is present, pressure within the system increases, giving rise to reflux of bacteria or their toxic products into the hepatic venous circulation. This cholangiovenous reflux produces chills, fever, and the hemodynamic changes of sepsis. Death may ensue if treatment is not instituted promptly. Choledocholithiasis, the most commonly associated problem, may produce partial or complete obstruction. When bacteria are not present in the bile duct system, choledocholithiasis may go undetected unless the degree of obstruction is sufficient to cause jaundice.

Thus, recurrent episodes of cholangitis signal the need for diagnostic studies. Cholangiography usually will be necessary. The presence of any foreign body in the biliary tract is frequently associated with bactibilia and recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Even a silk suture exposed to the lumen of a bile duct has been known to cause cholangitis. Pigment stone and sludge formation may result from the bacterial deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide to bilirubin monoglucuronide, which precipitates as calcium bilirubinate. This material can occlude indwelling tubes and predispose to more frequent episodes of cholangitis. Long-term administration of an oral antibiotic may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of cholangitis; however, this method of management should not be routine. Correction of the underlying problem is essential. Chronic obstruction and recurrent infection eventually lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis and its complications of portal hypertension, ascites, and bleeding esophageal varices. Once this stage of the disease is reached, correction of the underlying biliary tract problem does not reverse the changes in the liver. Once again, every effort should be made to eliminate the cause of the cholangitis early in the course of disease.

This can be done by intubating the duct system through the percutaneous, transhepatic, or the endoscopic route or by insertion of a T tube in the common duct at operation. Removal of the stone causing the obstruction is not necessary to stabilize the patient. Only after the duct is decompressed should the cause of the obstruction be addressed. When transhepatic biliary drainage has been used, endoscopic or surgical removal of the stone can be carried out after the patient has recovered completely. When initial therapy is sphincterotomy, the stone should be removed as part of the procedure. Often the stone falls out without manipulation. If surgical placement of a T tube is the initial treatment, the stone should be removed only if it is convenient to do so.

The great majority of cases of gallstone ileus are preceded by a spontaneous fistula occurring between the gallbladder and duodenum, allowing gallstones to enter the intestinal tract, which can potentially block the terminal ileum. Finding air within the biliary tree should always arouse suspicion of the possibility of this diagnosis when it is associated with a radiographic pattern of small bowel obstruction. The initial part of the operative approach to this disease is to relieve the bowel obstruction by performing an enterotomy just proximal to the point of obstruction to remove the stone. Where possible, definitive repair of the fistula should be undertaken to avoid recurrent obstruction and to obviate the possible recurring complications of cholangitis. Percutaneous drainage of bile collections combined with endoscopic papillotomy may be sufficient treatment for external and internal biliary fistulas but is never an allowable approach in the presence of gallstone ileus with small bowel obstruction. Relief of the obstruction is mandated in this setting.",

Approximately 25% of gastrinoma patients have the disease associated with the MEN-1 syndrome, whereas 75% have a sporadic variety of the disease. Recent evidence indicates that extrapancreatic gastrinomas are common. Careful attention must be paid to the duodenum and peripancreatic lymph nodes at the time of abdominal exploration. Before elective operation it is imperative that the gastric acid hypersecretion be controlled. The control of gastric hypersecretion is best performed by the administration of one of the substituted benzimidazoles, such as omeprazole or lansoprazole.",

        "explanation": "Enzyme secretion is regulated primarily through hormonal and neural factors. The enteric hormone cholecystokinin, released from endocrine cells in the duodenal mucosa, is the predominant regulator and stimulates acinar cells through specific membrane-bound receptors. Acetylcholine strongly stimulates acinar cells when released from postganglionic fibers of the pancreatic plexus and acts in synergy with CCK to potentiate enzyme secretion. Secretin weakly stimulates acinar cell secretion and potentiates the effect of cholecystokinin on the acinar cells. Bicarbonate is formed from carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. Secretin, the major stimulant for bicarbonate secretion, is released from the duodenal mucosa in response to a duodenal luminal pH of less than 3.0. Cholecystokinin only weakly stimulates bicarbonate secretion, whereas it potentiates secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion. Gastrin and acetylcholine are weak stimulants of bicarbonate secretion.",

All venous effluent from the pancreas ultimately drains into the portal vein which is formed by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein at the superior border of the pancreas. The anterior and posterior venous arcades in the head of the pancreas drain directly into the suprapancreatic portal vein. The anteroinferior pancreaticoduodenal arcades drain with the right gastroepiploic vein to form a common venous trunk with the right colic vein. This trunk is known as the gastrocolic trunk and enters the superior mesenteric vein at the inferior border of the neck of the pancreas. The posteroinferior venous arcade empties directly into the superior mesenteric vein. The veins of the head drain laterally into the superior mesenteric and portal veins.

Hormones that stimulate insulin secretion include glucagon, GIP, and cholecystokinin, whereas somatostatin, amylin, and pancreastatin are inhibitory.

Clinical trials of glucagon and calcitonin based on the same principle have produced a similar lack of supportive data. More recently, a somatostatin analog has been subjected to clinical trials for patients with acute pancreatitis. Somatostatin inhibits pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion by preventing the normal release of cholecystokinin, secretin, and other gut peptides. Despite the theoretical appeal, it has not been possible to demonstrate that somatostatin alters the natural history or prognosis of simple acute pancreatitis, although it does diminish pancreatic secretion. Peritoneal lavage as a specific therapy for acute pancreatitis was proposed after experimental studies demonstrated improved survival in animals with fulminant pancreatitis. The concept was appealing in that activated proteases and other vasoactive substances identifiable in peritoneal aspirates from patients with pancreatitis would be removed, rather than systemically absorbed. Unfortunately, clinical trials using this approach have produced disappointing results, and the eventual overall mortality rate appears unchanged.",

Direct manipulation or retraction of the pancreas or pancreatic duct appears to be the most common cause. About 1% of patients develop acute pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This is a predictable event, and the risk can be minimized by limiting the pressure used for contrast injection of the pancreatic duct. Acute pancreatitis also occurs in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery and a variety of other procedures remote from the pancreas.

External drainage is chosen in the presence of infection or an immature capsule. The disadvantages of external drainage include the risk of pancreatic fistula formation and a pseudocyst recurrence. External drainage has been associated with a higher mortality rate, probably because it is used in patients at higher risk, especially those with sepsis, pancreatic abscesses, or ruptured pseudocysts. The type of internal drainage procedure selected depends on the location of the pseudocyst and whether or not there is associated pancreatic ductal pathology. Cystogastrostomy is the simplest and safest alternative if the pseudocyst is appropriately adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach. Cystojejunostomy using a Roux-en-Y or loop jejunostomy may also be appropriate, depending on the location and specific anatomy of the pseudocyst.

        "explanation": "In autopsy series, the evidence for past acute pancreatitis averages 0.31%. Variations among populations are highly dependent on social factors such as ethanol use and on environmental and hereditary determinants such as the incidence of gallstones. Acute pancreatitis may occur at any age but is most common in adults between 30 and 70 years of age. In general, patients with gallstone-induced pancreatitis are older (age 40 to 60 years), whereas those with alcohol-associated pancreatitis are younger (age 30 to 40 years). The sex distribution of acute pancreatitis depends on the clinical cause of the disease, with women representing 68% of patients with gallstone-associated pancreatitis. Conversely, when alcohol is the primary association, men account for most patients. Clinical associations with acute pancreatitis can be divided into three broad categories-biliary stones, ethanol, and others. Biliary tract stone disease and ethanol-induced pancreatitis account for most cases of acute pancreatitis reported worldwide. The particular distribution of causes reflects the source of the patient population evaluated. In a summary of 18 different reports of acute pancreatitis in the United States with a combined total of 7147 patients, 53% of patients were believed to have ethanol-induced disease, whereas 28% had proven biliary stones. In contrast, of 1539 patients reported on from Great Britain, 52% had gallstones, 7% were ethanol related, and 34% had no identifiable cause.",

The average daily intake of alcohol is 150 to 175 g with the mean duration of alcoholism before recognition of pancreatitis being 18 years for men and 11 years for women. The incidence of chronic pancreatitis on autopsy studies of chronic alcoholics is 50 times the rate of non-drinking controls. Only 10% of alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis—suggesting that factors other than long-term alcohol exposure may also influence susceptibility.

Indirect tests of pancreatic function which measure absorption of nutrients that first require pancreatic digestion are not helpful in early cases of chronic pancreatitis. Clinically detectable malabsorption is absent until 90% of exocrine function is lost. Because of this, indirect tests of pancreatic function do not detect early disease. In addition, false positive tests may occur in other disease states associated with malabsorption (Crohn’s disease, sprue, postgastrectomy states, or in association with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, or renal disease.

The anterior surface of the pancreas is exposed through the lesser sac. The entire pancreatic duct is opened from the pancreatic tail to a point 1 cm from the duodenum. A side-to-side anastomosis is then performed between the opened pancreatic duct and a loop of jejunum. Splenectomy is not necessary.

Fibrosis associated with chronic pancreatitis can encase and compress the common bile duct. Common bile duct stenosis is relatively common in chronic pancreatitis, occurring in approximately 10% of cases observed long-term.

Enlarged nodes in these areas should undergo biopsy and be submitted for frozen-section examination, since tumor in these areas is beyond the bounds of standard pancreaticoduodenectomy and constitutes a contraindication to resection. If there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy, a dissection between the anterior surface of the portal vein and the posterior surface of the neck of the pancreas is performed. Ordinarily, only thin areolar tissue lies between the pancreas and the portal vein, and a communication behind the neck of the pancreas can be established.

Most studies estimate that smoking results in a two-to three-fold increase in risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Alcohol consumption has been implicated in some case-control studies of pancreatic cancer, but the overall evidence is inconsistent and alcohol is not likely to be a major factor in the development of the disease. Although considerable public interest was focused in the past few years on coffee consumption as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, evidence linking coffee consumption to pancreatic cancer is not compelling. Abnormal glucose tolerance is present in about 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer, if carefully sought. Although diabetes and pancreatic cancer occur together far more frequently than would be expected by chance, persons with long-standing diabetes are not at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis is a significant risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. It appears that all forms of chronic pancreatitis are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, suggesting that it is the pancreatitis and not the injuring agent which is responsible for the augmented cancer risk. Studies indicate that patients who have previously undergone gastric resection may be from three to seven times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than a control population. There have been several reports of familial clustering of pancreatic cancer. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that about 7% of pancreatic cancer patients have a positive family history of the disease. For most cases, however, no hereditary basis for pancreatic cancer has been identified.",

        "explanation": "When jaundiced patients undergo exploration in the hopes of resection but unresectable disease is found, biliary bypass should be performed. The jejunum is typically chosen as a conduit in preference to the duodenum because duodenal obstruction may occur as the tumor becomes more advanced. There has been much discussion over the use of the bile duct or the gallbladder for biliary decompression. Operative mortality and mean survival (about 6 months) do not differ between patients with cholecystojejunostomy and choledochojejunostomy. Recurrent jaundice is more common after cholecystojejunostomy. Because recurrent jaundice constitutes a failure of palliation, the use of the common duct for biliary bypass is preferable in most patients. There are circumstances, however, in which it may be more appropriate to use the gallbladder. Such instances include patients with poor performance status, cases in which the tumor is bulky and invades the porta hepatis, or when periductal varices have developed as a result of portal vein thrombosis. The suitability of the gallbladder as a biliary conduit must be proven intraoperatively. If, on aspiration, the gallbladder contains colorless fluid, the cystic duct may be assumed to be obstructed, and the gallbladder should be removed and not used for bypass. If there is green bile in the gallbladder, patency of the cystic duct should be proved by cholangiography before a bypass is performed.",

However, fasting hypergastrinemia alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis of gastrinoma. Gastric acid analysis is an important test in the evaluation of patients with suspected gastrinoma, as it can differentiate between ulcerogenic causes of hypergastrinemia and nonulcerogenic causes of hypergastrinemia. The diagnosis of gastrinoma is supported by a basal acid output above 15 mEq/hour in nonoperated patients. Following documentation that hypergastrinemia is associated with excessive acid secretion, provocative testing using secretin should be performed to differentiate between gastrinoma, antral G cell hyperplasia/hyperfunction, and the other causes of ulcerogenic hypergastrinemia. The secretin stimulation test is carried out in the fasting state by obtaining peripheral serum samples for gastrin in the basal period, administering secretin (2 units/kg body weight) as an intravenous bolus, and obtaining serum samples for gastrin at five minute intervals for 30 minutes. An increase in the gastrin level of more than 200 pg/ml above the basal level is supportive of the diagnosis of gastrinoma.",

Instead, insulinoma is most reliably diagnosed using the technique of a monitored fast. During a monitored fast, blood for glucose and insulin determinations is sampled every four to six hours, and at the time of symptom occurrence. Hypoglycemic symptoms typically occur when glucose levels are less than 50 mg/dl, with concurrent serum insulin levels often being greater than 25 µU/ml. Additional support for the diagnosis of insulinoma comes from the calculation of the insulin to glucose ratio (I:G ratio) at different time points during the monitored fast. Normal individuals will have I:G ratios less than 0.3, while patients with insulinoma typically demonstrate I:G ratios greater than 0.4 after a prolonged fast. Other measurable beta cell products synthesized in excess in patients with insulinoma include C peptide and proinsulin. Elevated levels of C peptide and proinsulin are typically found in the peripheral blood in patients with insulinoma. The possibility of surreptitious insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent administration should be considered in all patients with suspected insulinoma. C peptide and proinsulin levels will not be elevated in patients self-administering insulin.

Conventional CT scanning includes 0.5–1 cm axial images of the liver after oral administration of barium and bolus injection of intravenous contrast. Although resolution has improved, hepatic lesions below 1 cm in size or lesions that are isodense with hepatic parenchyma may be missed. Resolution of hepatic lesions has been greatly enhanced by the combination of visceral angiography and CT scanning, known as CT arterio-portography (CTAP). Immediate CT scanning after injection of contrast directly into the common hepatic artery may identify small hepatic lesions which usually show increased density relative to the surrounding hepatic parenchyma. CT arterio-portography also includes direct injection of contrast into the splenic or superior mesenteric arteries, with CT imaging during the portal venous phase of this injection. Hepatic lesions supplied by the hepatic artery thus appear as discrete hypodense lesions surrounded by normal hepatic parenchyma enhanced by portal venous contrast. Recently, double helical (spiral) CT scanning has become available and shows considerable promise to complement or replace CTAP for preoperative imaging. This technique allows total hepatic imaging in both the arterial and arterial/venous phases after a single rapid bolus injection of intravenous contrast during a single breath hold by the patient. It is possible to visualize the portal structures and hepatic veins on a single scan and give a high resolution of small hepatic lesions. In addition, three-dimensional reconstructions can be created to further delineate hepatic parenchyma and demonstrate a CT constructed hepatic arteriogram. This technique may completely replace the need for invasive arteriography to characterize the blood supply to the liver prior to hepatic resection or after hepatic transplantation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver has results similar to CT scanning, but to date has not demonstrated improvements sufficient to justify the increased cost associated with the technique.",

        "explanation": "For major hepatic resections and for complete intraoperative ultrasound, complete mobilization of the liver will be required. After detachment of the hepatic flexure of the colon and division of the falciform ligament, both the left and right triangular ligaments must be sharply taken down to fully mobilize the liver. During division of the right triangular ligament, care must be taken to avoid injury to the right diaphragm, the right adrenal gland and adrenal vein, the right phrenic vein, and several moderate-size accessory right hepatic veins draining directly into the vena cava. After mobilization, digital and bimanual palpation is performed and intraoperative ultrasound may be performed. Dissection of the porta hepatis is performed by many hepatic surgeons to identify the main bifurcations of the hepatic artery, bile duct, and portal vein. This allows individual ligation of unilateral branches of each of these structures during hepatic lobectomy but prior to parenchymal dissection. An alternative approach has been recently described where the main portal structures are left undisturbed and branches to a given lobe are ligated during parenchymal transection. Hemorrhage can be minimized by intermittent portal inflow occlusion by clamping or compression of the portal triad (Pringle maneuver). There has been considerable debate over early versus late isolation and ligation of a given hepatic vein during lobectomy since the extraparenchymal component of the hepatic vein may be quite short or absent. Since hemorrhage in this location may be difficult to control, a safe strategy is to always avoid early isolation of a given hepatic vein or to attempt isolation only when a considerable length of vein is found on mobilization of the respective triangular ligament.",

        "explanation": "There are three major hepatic veins which carry blood from the central veins of the hepatic substance to the inferior vena cava (IVC). In two-thirds of patients, there is a single large right hepatic vein which joins the right anterior wall of the IVC and a middle and a left hepatic vein which converge one-to-two cm from the IVC and enter the left anterior wall of the IVC as a single vessel. In one-third of patients, each major hepatic vein joins at the same horizontal level of the IVC as a separate trunk. In some patients, there is a short but definable extraparenchymal segment of one or more of the hepatic veins at the confluence with the IVC. More frequently, the entire length of the hepatic veins is intraparenchymal, which may preclude early, safe hepatic venous isolation during hepatic resection. There is considerable variability in the origin and course of the right and left hepatic arteries. The most common finding (55% of patients) is a transverse common hepatic artery from the celiac trunk which gives off the gastroduodenal, right gastric, and supraduodenal arteries and courses obliquely in the left anterior aspect of the hepatoduodenal ligament as a proper hepatic artery. After giving off the cystic artery to the gallbladder, there is then a fairly low trifurcation into a single right, middle, and left hepatic arteries. Knowledge of the most common variations is extremely importance since inadvertent division may occur during gastric, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary procedures. There may be a replaced or accessory left hepatic artery which arises from the left gastric artery and courses transversely in the lesser omentum. With nearly equal frequency, there is a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery near its origin which courses posterior or through the head of the pancreas obliquely along the right posterior border of the hepatoduodenal ligament. Although original anatomic descriptions deny the existence of collateral vessels to the opposite hepatic lobe, image perfusion studies after ligation of main or replaced hepatic arteries have clearly demonstrated the presence of collateral flow to the deprived lobe.",

        "explanation": "Serum glucose is tightly regulated by the liver despite wide fluctuations in dietary ingestion. The liver can take up as much as 100 g/day of glucose and convert it to glycogen by the process of glycogenesis. The liver can also release glucose into the blood by glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen, or by gluconeogenesis, the formation of new glucose from substrates such as alanine, lactate, glycerol or dietary amino acids. Hormones play a key role in hepatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin, for example, stimulates glycogenesis, and glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is also enhanced by fasting, critical illness and periods of anaerobic metabolism. Glycogen is a complex polymer of glucose. Liver cells can store up to 8% of their weight as glycogen. The first step in glycogen storage is the transport of glucose through the hepatocyte plasma membrane. About 90% of portal venous glucose is removed from the blood by liver cells through carrier-facilitated diffusion. The rate of glucose transport is enhanced by insulin. Once in the hepatocyte, glucose and ATP are converted by the enzyme glucokinase to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), the first intermediate in the synthesis of glycogen. Because complete oxidation of one molecule of G6P generates 37 molecules of ATP, and storage only uses one molecule of ATP, the overall efficiency of glucose storage in glycogen is a remarkable 97%. Glycolysis is the pathway by which glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvate and occurs in the cytoplasm in contrast to the citric acid cycle which occurs in the mitochondria.",

Within this phospholipid bilayer are proteins which serve either structural functions or metabolic functions. The hepatocyte sinusoidal plasma membrane is heavily studded with microvilli to increase the absorptive area in contact with sinusoidal blood. The cell membrane, by virtue of its high lipid content, allows lipid-soluble molecules to enter the cell by simple diffusion. Polar molecules must enter cells via membrane transport proteins. Channel proteins allow molecules to diffuse simply into cells without binding, whereas carrier proteins first bind the solute and, by conformational change, allow it to be transported into the cell. The glucose carrier in hepatocytes is an example of carrier-facilitated diffusion. The sinusoidal membrane is studded with receptors, which are large glycoprotein molecules that span the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. A ligand-binding site of this receptor molecule projects into the space of Disse. When appropriate ligand-receptor binding occurs, the entire ligand may be internalized for intracellular degradation or biliary transport, or the ligand may transmit a signal to the interior of the hepatocyte by a number of intracellular second messenger systems, a process known as signal transduction. Such second messengers include cAMP, inositol triphosphate, and diacylglycerol.

Under certain conditions, the amine group is removed from the amino acids, and the carbon chain is used for carbohydrate, lipid, or nonessential amino acid synthesis. The ammonia formed as the result of deamination of amino acids is detoxified by one of two routes. The most important pathway involves conversion of ammonia to urea by enzymes of the Krebs-Henseleit cycle, found only in the liver. A second route of ammonia metabolism involves deamination of L-glutamine by the kidney, with excretion of ammonia into the urine. Essentially all albumin, fibrinogen, and apolipoproteins are derived from the liver which can add up to 50 grams of protein to the plasma per day. Of total hepatic protein synthesis, 75% is destined for export in plasma. Albumin, an important plasma protein synthesized in the liver, has a long half-life in plasma of about 19 days.

The major solutes are conjugated bile acids, phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol, protein and bilirubin. Bile acids are the main determinant of bile production, and canalicular bile flow is traditionally divided into bile acid-dependent and bile acid-independent components. Primary bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and in humans consist of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Secondary bile acids are formed in the intestinal lumen by bacterial dehydroxylation and consist of deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid derived from cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, respectively. Essentially all primary and secondary bile acids are conjugated with the amino acids glycine or taurine. The human liver synthesizes 300 to 400 mg per day of bile acids from cholesterol, or about 10% of the total bile salt pool. Normally intestinal bile acids are efficiently (about 95%) taken up by the enterohepatic circulation.

The mitochondrial hydrolysis of fatty acids is a source of large quantities of ATP. The conversion of stearic acid to CO2 and H2O, for instance, generates 136 ATP molecules and demonstrates the highly efficient storage of energy in fat. In times of unrestrained lipolysis, such as starvation, uncontrolled diabetes or other conditions of triglyceride mobilization from adipose tissue, the ability of the liver to perform beta-oxidation may be inadequate. Under these circumstances, significant hepatic storage of triglycerides or fatty infiltration of the liver may occur. Triglyceride storage by itself does not appear to be a cause of hepatic fibrosis or necrosis, but fatty infiltration may be a marker for derangement of normal processes by alcohol or drug toxicity, diabetes, chronic parenteral nutrition, or morbid obesity. Cholesterol is an important regulator of membrane fluidity and is a substrate for bile acid and steroid hormone synthesis. Cholesterol may be available by dietary intake or by de novo synthesis. In mammals, about 90% of new cholesterol is synthesized by the liver from its precursor, acetyl CoA. Dietary cholesterol intake suppresses endogenous synthesis by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol by a synthetic pathway, HMG-CoA reductase. There are three major classes of phospholipids synthesized by the liver: the lecithins, the cephalins, and the sphingomyelins. Although most cells in the body are capable of some phospholipid synthesis, the liver produces 90%.",

The most common identifiable sources of acquisition of hepatitis C virus are prior transfusion of blood or blood-derived products or a history of intravenous illicit drug use. The usual incubation period of post-transfusion hepatitis C viral infection is 5 to 10 weeks. An initial elevation of liver enzymes may be associated with little or no clinical disturbance. In some patients, acute hepatitis C viral infection does not progress to chronic infection, however, chronic hepatitis C viral infection develops in up to 70% of patients with post-transfusion hepatitis C infection with many progressing to cirrhosis. Hepatitis C does not appear to alter life expectancy at least in the first 15 years of infection. However, once cirrhosis and end stage liver disease develop, the clinical syndrome is indistinguishable from other forms of chronic liver disease with a predisposition to the development of hepatoma. Interferon alpha is the only FDA approved therapy for chronic hepatitis C viral infection. There is some evidence that early administration of interferon in acute hepatitis C viral infection may reduce the risk of progression to the chronic state. As yet, there is no evidence that interferon alters the natural history of chronic hepatitis C viral infection or changes the incidence.",

The presence of calcifications and daughter cysts within the parent cyst suggests Echinococcus. Percutaneous needling of a hydatid cyst is unwise unless precautions against anaphylaxis are undertaken. A cyst’s fluid is often under pressure, and needling may precipitate rupture with the potential for anaphylaxis or intraperitoneal seating. The classic treatment of hydatid cysts is operative. The surgical aim is to remove the cyst or cysts without dissemination of the organism. At operation, the cyst is drained of fluid through a cannula after carefully protecting the operative field from fluid leakage. If the aspirate is clear a parasiticidal fluid (ethyl alcohol or 20% sterile saline) is injected into the cyst to kill any adherent scoleces. The cyst contents and the pericystic wall is then removed with careful surgical dissection.",

        "explanation": "The diagnosis of acute (fulminant) hepatic failure is based on the development of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. The overall prognosis is poor, but the hepatic lesions are potentially reversible, and recovery can lead to restoration of normal liver function. The most frequent cause of acute hepatic failure world-wide is non-A, non-B viral hepatitis. A variety of other viral agents and hepatotoxins can also cause this condition. No reliable criteria predict outcome and response to treatment. Higher grades of encephalopathy (depth of coma) on admission are associated with the worst prognosis. Management should include general supportive measures and specific treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, electrolyte and metabolic disturbances, infection, and pain. Hypoglycemia is an unusual complication of most liver diseases except in patients with acute hepatic failure or hepatic neoplasms. The enormous reserve capacity of the liver accounts for the rarity of hypoglycemia except as a preterminal event. Bleeding is also a frequent cause of death in patients with acute hepatic failure secondary to depressed liver synthesis of clotting factors and qualitative or quantitative platelet disorders. The lack of a definitive medical treatment for acute hepatic failure makes liver transplantation seem attractive especially for patients with little or no chance of recovering normal liver function. Perhaps the most significant drawback to widespread acceptance of liver transplantation for acute hepatic failure is the lack of criteria reliability to predict which patients are likely to benefit from operation. Patients with mild to moderate degrees of coma are likely to recovery spontaneously without the need for liver transplantation while rapid deterioration and neurologic status to grade III or grade IV coma are associated in some centers with a mortality of 95%.",

The prognosis worsened considerably once patients developed clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation (ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Among these patients, the probability of five-year survival was only 16%. The risk of death from variceal hemorrhage depends much more of the severity of the underlying liver disease than on the type of therapy. It would also appear from natural history studies that continued alcohol consumption does affect survival. In one study, the overall five-year survival is 63% for abstainers versus 40.5% for those who continued to drink. Continued alcohol consumption may have less of an effect on survival than the intensity of alcohol consumption.

Biliary cirrhosis is characterized by a coarsely granular macronodular liver. This condition results from long-standing cholestasis secondary to obstruction of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. The most distinctive feature of large duct obstruction is the presence of bile leaks caused by rupture of bile duct with extravasation of bile into portal triads.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs as a complication of cirrhotic ascites in up to 10% of patients. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is defined as infected ascitic fluid without a demonstrable other site of infection. This is a serious complication with reported in-hospital mortality rates of 60% to 90%. The rational approach of therapy for ascites includes sodium and fluid restriction, the use of diuretics, and the use of therapeutic paracentesis. Several studies have shown that repeated paracentesis in stable cirrhotic patients may be safe and effective as medical therapy and shortens the length of hospitalization. Single, large volume paracentesis has been reported to be effective and safe. Up to 10 liters of ascites can be removed in one hour if salt-poor albumen is administered simultaneously. In a small percentage of patients, surgical implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt may be advisable. The principal indication for use of peritoneovenous shunt is to stabilize ascites that is refractory to conventional medical therapy and therapeutic paracentesis. Despite the simplistic nature of the device, postoperative mortality and morbidity rates of 20% to 60%, respectively have been reported. Precipitation of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, variceal hemorrhage, or hepatic failure may complicate this procedure. Transintrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) have been demonstrated to control ascites in one study in over 90% of patients with ascites refractory to medical management. However, patients with poor hepatic reserve in this study all died if orthotopic liver transplantation was not performed. This data suggests that TIPS is effective for refractive ascites in patients with good to moderate hepatic reserve but poor risk cirrhotics require orthotopic liver transplantation to correct this problem.",

The eventual development of cirrhosis is determined by the nature and severity of the cellular injury and the liver’s ability to regenerate. Most infectious hepatitides are viral in origin. There is no documentation that hepatitis A progresses to cirrhosis, however hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis do demonstrate a propensity to become chronic with the development of cirrhosis. Chemical hepatotoxicity include direct and indirect actions. Acetaminophen under normal circumstances is detoxified chiefly by conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulfate. Saturation of glucuronic pathway with large doses of acetaminophen results in progressive depletion of intracellular glutathione stores, accumulation of toxic intermediate, and eventual cell necrosis which may progress to either acute liver failure or chronic cirrhosis. Alcohol can affect liver cell function in a number of ways. Like many hepatotoxins, the toxic effects of alcohol are caused indirectly by reactive intermediates. Acetaldehyde is the principal reactive compound generated by alcohol metabolism. The hepatotoxicity of acetaldehyde is related to its binding two major constituents of cellular membranes altering membrane integrity and enzymatic function frequently to the detriment of the cell. Early morphologic changes of long-standing cardiac decompensation and right-sided heart failure are central lobular congestion, hemorrhage, and necrosis combined with phlebosclerosis of central veins and scars connecting centrizonal areas (cardiac cirrhosis).",

Another hypothesis has implicated false neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Evidence suggests that activation of the GABA system may be important in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The GABA receptor binds several classes of ligands including GABA and drugs such as benzodiazepines.

        "explanation": "A number of invasive and noninvasive therapies exist for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Vasopressin is frequently used in the treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage and acts by decreasing portal venous pressure or flow through splanchnic vasoconstriction. Vasopressin alone has been reported to temporarily control variceal hemorrhage in 50% to 75% of patients, however, it can be associated with cardiac and peripheral extremity cutaneous ischemia. Somatostatin also acts as a vasoconstrictor to reduce splanchnic flow, with trials demonstrating similar efficacy in controlling acute hemorrhage when compared to vasopressin but without the cardiac side effects. Balloon tamponade is generally used for the temporary control of acute variceal hemorrhage unresponsive to vasopressin or sclerotherapy. Initial control of acute variceal hemorrhage occurs in about 80% of patients, but bleeding recurs promptly on deflation of the balloons in over 50%. Endoscopic sclerotherapy has become the primary treatment for bleeding esophageal varices. A number of clinical trials demonstrate that emergent sclerotherapy is able to halt variceal bleeding that fails to respond to more conservative measures, with no increase in frequency or severity of complications. The long-term survival of patients treated with sclerotherapy continues to be debated. Metaanalysis has been performed on the data from seven randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of repeated sclerotherapy on long-term survival. This analysis demonstrates that sclerotherapy reduces the number of deaths by 25% therefore supporting the use of sclerotherapy as an effective means of prolonging survival in patients who have experienced variceal hemorrhage.",

        "explanation": "Although portosystemic shunts are the most effective therapy for preventing recurrent variceal hemorrhage, they are associated with the increased incidence of encephalopathy. A number of types of shunts have been described, primarily to avoid the consequences of complete diversion of portal blood flow or to simplify the operation. End-to-side portocaval shunts are hemodynamically unique in that all portal flow is diverted and the hepatic limb of the portal vein is ligated, thus preventing hepatofugal blood flow from the liver. With lateral side-to-side shunts, the hepatic limb of the portal vein remains patent. A greater compensatory increase in hepatic arterial flow occurs when the portal vein serves as an outflow track and the liver extracts oxygen and metabolites from the blood exiting through the patent limb of the portal vein (hepatofugal). The goal of selective shunts is to preserve prograde (hepatopedal) portal flow to the liver while selectively decompressing gastroesophageal varices (Warren shunt) or reducing portal pressures sufficiently to prevent variceal hemorrhage (small-diameter shunts). Most surgeons with a special interest in this field attempt to construct a selective shunt when the operation is elective, unless contraindications are present. The distal splenorenal shunt of Warren and the small-diameter interposition portocaval shunt of Sarfeh are the most common selective shunts used. The Warren shunt is an ascitogenic operation and therefore the presence of ascites that is difficult to control medically is a contraindication of this operation. An interposition mesocaval shunt is frequently preferred in emergent situations because the shunt is relatively safe to construct and promptly halts variceal hemorrhage. If future hepatic transplantation is contemplated, this shunt offers the advantages in that it does not involve dissection of the area of the hepatoduodenal ligament.",

Less encephalopathy is also seen with the selective Sarfeh shunt and after nonshunting procedures, such as sclerotherapy or devascularization. When comparing shunts with nonshunting procedures, only minor differences in long-term survival are reported, but the mode of death usually changes. With nonshunting procedures, a greater proportion of patients die of recurrent hemorrhage; after construction of a shunt, a greater proportion die of hepatic failure. Class A patients undergoing distal splenorenal shunts can be predicted to have an actuarial survival including operative mortality in excess of 80%.

Dynamic CT scanning remains the dominant imaging modality for routine screening and diagnosis because it is sensitive, widely available, provides helpful anatomic information and allows the evaluation of other intraabdominal structures in the detection of extrahepatic disease. The most sensitive test for the detection of liver masses is CTAP, however, like angiography is generally reserved for preoperative evaluation of resectability and not for screening. Hepatic MRI imaging is another useful tool in the detection and diagnosis of the liver lesions, with sensitivities equal to that of CT. MRI with T1 and T2-weighted images and gadilinium enhancement can aid in the differential diagnosis of a mass. For example, MRI is now considered the test of choice for distinguishing hemangiomas from other mass lesions. Radionucleotide imaging is less sensitive and specific than CT, MRI, or ultrasound, and has a high percentage of false-positive and false-negative results. Therefore, nuclear medicine scans play a limited role in modern screening and detection, but they can help differentiate discrete masses.",

In the absence of complications, laboratory abnormalities are uncommon. Cysts are somewhat more common in females, are more common in the right lobe and are often multilocular rather than unilocular. They are lined with cuboidal epithelium resembling bile duct epithelium and are filled with fluid that may be clear, mucoid, bloody, or bilious. If the patient has no symptoms and the cyst was discovered incidentally and there is no evidence of infection or malignancy, one may observe the patient. Neither percutaneous aspiration nor surgery is indicated. Cysts nearly always recur after simple aspiration. Treatment of symptomatic cysts is surgical. Indications for surgery include symptoms, rupture, hemorrhage, or infection. Asymptomatic, uninfected simple cysts are best treated by excision, if possible. Larger cysts may be inroofed with free peritoneal drainage unless there is a history of hemorrhage or evidence of biliary communication. A laparoscopic approach to the unroofing of cysts has recently been reported with excellent success.

The risks associated with needle biopsy include bleeding, infection, needle track seeding of tumor, and sampling error. Hypervascular masses, coagulopathy, and ascites are contraindications to percutaneous core biopsy, however, FNA biopsy is generally considered safe under these circumstances. In evaluation of any liver mass, percutaneous biopsy should be performed only if it can reasonably be expected to obviate the need for exploratory laparotomy. Biopsy of suspected primary metastatic malignancy with clinical indications of unresectability may spare the patient an unnecessary laparotomy.

Overall, hemangiomas are exceeded only by hepatic metastases as the most common hepatic tumor. Cavernous hemangiomas consist histologically of cystically dilated, endothelium-lined vascular spaces. They occur in all ages but are observed more commonly in females. Hemangiomas are not premalignant. Less than half of affected patients have symptoms. Those that have symptoms usually have large masses. Symptoms usually occur including vague right upper quadrant discomfort, pain, fullness, and early satiety. Physical examination may be notable for hepatomegaly, mass or bruit. There are no laboratory abnormalities in patients with hemangiomas. The most useful radiologic test for diagnosing hemangiomas are MRI, CT and tagged red blood cell scanning. These tests have largely replaced angiography. CT with vascular contrast often demonstrates a diagnostically characteristic enhancement pattern. Gadilinium-enhanced MRI has recently been shown to be sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of hemangioma and has better resolution than tagged red blood cell scans. FNA biopsy of suspected hemangiomas can be performed, however this procedure should be avoided if the diagnosis is secure using noninvasive procedures. Given the natural history of hemangiomas and its low risk of rupture, observation is indicated for asymptomatic patients, especially for lesions smaller than 4 cm. Surgical excision is the only consistently effective treatment for symptomatic masses and should be performed if the lesion is localized and accessible with an acceptable operative risk.

There does appear to be some link between hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis C virus.

No radiologic test is specific for adenomas. CT is the most useful preliminary test and often reveals areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.

Extrahepatic disease including lymph node involvement is a contraindication to resection or transplantation. No single-or multiple-agent chemotherapy is particularly effective in treating hepatocellular carcinoma. The rationale for treating vascular liver tumors with arterial obstruction is the fact that the nutritional blood supply of these tumors comes primarily from the hepatic artery.

The cystic duct passes downward, backward, and to the left in the hepatoduodenal ligament and usually unites with the main hepatic duct at an acute angle. Its course and mode of insertion into the common duct is highly variable. The common bile duct is formed by the union of the common hepatic and cystic ducts and is usually about 7 to 9 cm long. The junction of the distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct at the ampulla can take one of three configurations.

The body of the gallbladder extends from the fundus into the tapered portion, or neck, which curves backward and upward toward the transverse fissure of the liver and terminates in the cystic duct.

The gallbladder has an active mucosa and is able to absorb water and solutes against significant concentration gradients. Water absorption is linked to the transport of ions. The two major mechanisms of absorption are active and passive. In passive absorption, sodium and chloride enter the gallbladder epithelial cells because of electrochemical gradients. This results in an osmotic gradient, and water flows into the cell. Intracellular sodium is extruded across the basolateral membrane into the lateral intercellular spaces by active transport. The active transport of sodium against an electrochemical gradient is associated by an Na+-K+-ATPase pump. Cyclic AMP may inhibit NaCl-coupled transport and may also influence tight junction permeability. Other peptides, such as secretin, glucagon, and gastric inhibitory peptide, have been shown to inhibit absorption. Secretion by the gallbladder occurs either by inhibiting net ion and fluid absorption or with stimulation of bicarbonate secretory mechanisms. Gallbladder epithelium may also secrete mucin and nonmucin glycoproteins which may play a role in gallstone formation.",

The regulation of bile flow is primarily controlled by the sphincter and not by the surrounding smooth muscle of the duodenum. Relaxation of the sphincter occurs with CCK stimulation leading to diminished amplitude of phasic contractions and reduced basal pressure, allowing increased passive flow of bile into the duodenum. Parasympathetic stimulation also causes intermittent relaxation of the sphincter, and sympathetic splanchnic stimulation causes increased pressure. Abnormalities of the sphincter of Oddi may cause symptoms which are referable to the biliary tree or pancreas.

        "explanation": "Prior to the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there was tremendous enthusiasm for a number of nonsurgical techniques for managing gallstones. Dissolution of existing gallstones with pharmacologic agents has been addressed by several national cooperative studies. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the best, safest, and most effective commerically available drug currently available. However, it still has a rate of complete dissolution of only 40%. It is also estimated that only 10% of patients will be suitable candidates for this therapy. Furthermore, gallstone recurrence is a major problem. Actuarial life table analysis indicates that the risk of gallstone recurrence in patients who have undergone dissolution of gallstones with oral bile acid therapy is 50% by five years. The addition of extracorporial shock wave lithotripsy increases the efficiency of gallstone clearance and in selected patients complete fragment clearance can be obtained in over 90% of patients by one year. However, optimal results can be obtained only by setting relatively strict criteria for inclusion. In applying such criteria, less than 20% of patients in the United States would be considered eligible for ESWL. Similar problems with gallstone recurrence have been observed with this technique. Finally, contact dissolution primarily with the ether solvent methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is extremely effective in dissolving cholesterol gallstones. This technique, however, will work only in stones which are composed of cholesterol and the patient must have a demonstrably patent cystic duct before considering this treatment. As with oral dissolution and lithotripsy, gallstone recurrence will remain a problem with this technique.",

Although the clinical manifestations of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis may overlap and clinical distinction is often difficult, persistence of pain beyond a matter of hours and fever would strongly suggest acute cholecystitis. The primary events in the development of acute cholecystitis are chemical in nature with bacterial infection playing a minor role in the genesis of the disease. In normal healthy subjects without gallstones, incidence of positive bile cultures is essentially zero. In contrast, between 30 and 70% of patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis will have positive bile cultures. The incidence of positive bile cultures who undergo cholecystectomy increases significantly with age. Septic complications continue to be a significant source of morbidity after cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. These septic complications can best be prevented by the judicious use of appropriate antimicrobial agents. The goal of antimicrobial therapy should be establishment of adequate serum and tissue levels of antibiotic rather than selection of an antibiotic that is excreted into the bile. Given the bacteriology that is typical in patients with uncomplicated cholecystitis, an appropriate antibiotic regimen should provide for adequate coverage of gram-negative aerobes. Although technically more difficult, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be completed safely in the majority of patients with acute cholecystitis. Significant experience and good judgment, however, is essential in insuring optimal results. Laboratory data are often nonspecific with acute cholecystitis.

Absolute contraindications include the inability to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of inadequate training or equipment, poor candidate for general anesthesia, uncontrolled coagulopathy, peritonitis, or suspected gallbladder carcinoma. Factors previously considered relative contraindications have been identified but with appropriate skill and judgment do not preclude the laparoscopic technique. These include acute cholecystitis, morbid obesity, previous upper abdominal surgery, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and pregnancy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is clearly more difficult and while the conversion rate of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to an open procedure is less than 5% in the setting of acute cholecystitis, the rate is approximately 20–30%. The incidence of bile duct injury in large surveys in this country and abroad suggest that the incidence of bile duct injury with open cholecystectomy is less than 0.2%. Initially much higher, (approaching 1%), several series of laparoscopic cholecystectomy have documented that injuries to the bile ducts currently occur at the rate of 0.2–0.6% of cases.

Patients with gallstone ileus are best managed as if they had a mechanical small bowel obstruction with aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad spectrum antibiotics, and early laparotomy.

Although a number of factors may contribute to gallstone formation, a number of steps are considered critical in the formation of gallstones. These include cholesterol supersaturation whereby the amount of cholesterol present is in excess of the ability of the micelles and vesicles to transport cholesterol in a soluble state. In addition, the process by which cholesterol crystals form and agglomerate is referred to as nucleation. It is likely that the process of nucleation is altered by a number of biliary proteins or other compounds which may promote or inhibit the nucleation process. Gallbladder stasis provides the proper environment for gallbladder crystal precipitation and stone formation. The stagnant pool of bile within the gallbladder may facilitate both cholesterol supersaturation, the nucleation process, as well as altering the gallbladder’s absorptive or secretory functions. Although bilirubin has been suggested to play a small role in cholesterol gallstone formation, perhaps in either nucleation or solubilization of cholesterol, excessive production of bilirubin as seen in hemolytic disorders is associated primarily with the formation of pigment gallstones.",

        "explanation": "A number of radiographic studies can be used to diagnose cholelithiasis. Visualization of gallstones on plain abdominal radiographs is possible in about 20% of patients whose stones are grossly calcified. Traditionally, oral cholecystogram has been the gold standard for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected gallstones. Although the accuracy for oral cholecystography has been reported to be as high as 95%, several conditions preclude satisfactory examination, including acute illness; poor patient compliance; inability to absorb the tablets as the result of emesis, malabsorption, or diarrhea; and jaundice or hepatic dysfunction. Abdominal ultrasonography has therefore become the preferred test for evaluation of patients with suspected gallstones. Most large series suggest that diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for cholelithiasis exceeds 95%. In addition to detecting gallstones, information is provided concerning the size and shape of the gallbladder, gallbladder wall thickness, presence of pericholcystic fluid, or a sonographic Murphy’s sign. The latter has been suggested to have an 85% accuracy rate in patients with acute cholecystitis. Nonetheless, while abdominal sonography is most helpful in identifying the presence or absence of gallstones, it is of limited use in distinguishing chronic from acute cholecystitis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy provides information on the patency of the bile ducts, including the cystic duct. Recognition that cystic duct obstruction is the sine qua non of acute cholecystitis, failure of the gallbladder to visualize during hepatobiliary scintigraphy is highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Although a number of false positive exams can occur, nonvisualization of the gallbladder during hepatobiliary scanning in the appropriate clinical setting is highly diagnostic of acute cholecystitis.",

Therefore, mechanisms for maintaining cholesterol in solution have been evolved. For decades, the mixed micelle which is composed of the amphiphatic bile salts and phospholipid was considered the primary carrier of bile. More recently, it has been demonstrated that up to 70% of the total amount of cholesterol normally found in gallbladder bile is transported and solubilized in the vesicular form. Bile vesicles are composed primarily of phospholipid of which in the human, lecithin accounts of 90% of the phospholipid content.",

Gallstone disease is a much more common in women than men, however with the higher incidence of cholelithiasis in women persisting until the seventh or eighth decade of life, at which time the incidence approaches 20% in both men and women. Clinical evidence suggests a two to three-fold increase in the incidence of cholelithiasis among morbidly obese patients compared to age matched normal weight subjects. Interestingly, rapid weight loss has also been associated with secretion of cholesterol saturated bile and increased incidence of gallstones. Patients with diabetes mellitus have a two-fold increase of gallstone disease when compared to non-diabetics.

In the United States, although cholesterol calculi predominate, pigment stones constitute about 30% of all gallbladder stones. Pigment stones are characterized by a high concentration of bilirubin and a low cholesterol content. The high incidence of pigment gallstones in patients with hemolytic disorders probably results from the excessive loads of bilirubin being presented to the liver for excretion. Infection has been thought to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones in that unconjugated bilirubin, produced by bacterial deconjugation, is insoluble in water, and combines with calcium in bile to produce a calcium bilirubin matrix. Specific alterations in bile acid metabolism have been proposed to explain the increased incidence of pigment gallstones found in cirrhotics. Gallstones associated with morbid obesity and rapid weight loss appear to be primarily due to the increased hepatic secretion of cholesterol leading to a cholithogenic state.",

The lymphatic drainage of the gallbladder is to the cystic duct lymph node, to periportal lymph nodes, and then to celiac and superior mesenteric lymph nodes. These tumors can also spread into and around the cystic duct and may extend into the common bile duct, causing biliary obstruction. Besides direct extension and lymphatic spread of the tumor, distant metastases is possible but is less commonly seen. A staging system has been developed which takes into consideration lymphatic and venous drainage of the gallbladder.

This point emphasizes the importance of opening all gallbladders at the time of cholecystectomy so that any suspicious lesions can be immediately examined histologically. When gallbladder cancer is limited to mucosa and submucosa, cholecystectomy is adequate treatment and has a good prognosis, with up to 100% five year survival. When the cancer involves the deeper layers of the gallbladder wall, the prognosis is more grim. A 64% five year survival was reported in patients who had carcinoma confined to the mucosa and submucosa, whereas none of the patients with cancer involving all layers of the gallbladder wall survived more than 2.5 years. Even though these tumors are relatively localized at the time of cholecystectomy, cholecystectomy alone was not adequate treatment for long-term survival. In hopes of improving these survival rates and considering the lymphatic and venous drainage of the gallbladder, it has been recommended that gallbladder cancers be treated by cholecystectomy with wide resection of the liver around the gallbladder bed (liver segments IV and V) and regional lymphadenectomy. This procedure has been termed an \"extended cholecystectomy.\" Although this treatment has prolonged median survival, an overall improvement in five year survival has not been observed. When a gallbladder cancer has been recognized incidentally at the time of pathology examination after routine cholecystectomy, reexploration will likely show evidence of residual disease in the lymph nodes or adjacent liver and therefore resection of this residual disease may improve survival. More radical excision including hepatic resection and bile duct resection and sometimes even pancreaticoduodenectomy has been reported. However, the associated increased morbidity and mortality of these operations has not resulted in an improvement in survival.",

The prognosis for patients with hilar bile duct cancer (Klatskin tumors) is extremely poor with mortality rates of 80% to 90% in five years. Most patients are unresectable at the time of diagnosis. Unless contraindicated for other reasons, however, surgical exploration should be performed in all patients whose tumors are potentially resectable. Hepatic lobectomy is indicated for potential cure if the bile duct lesion extends into the hepatic parenchyma. Regardless of the surgical therapy, stenting of the biliary anastomosis is important since postoperative strictures or recurrent tumors are common and long-standing stents allow for cholangiographic followup and for dilatation should strictures arise. These stents have also been used for placement of iridium seeds used for local irradiation. More aggressive surgical therapy including complete hepatic resection followed by hepatic transplantation have been performed.

The diagnosis begins with abdominal imaging to detect ductal dilatation. A CT appearance of a proximal cholangiocarcinoma or a Klatskin tumor will show a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree with a decompressed gallbladder and normal caliber distal bile duct. When biliary obstruction is present, further visualization of the biliary tree is required either through percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). PTC is preferred for more proximal lesions because ERCP may fail to adequately visualize the proximal portion of the biliary tree. For lower bile duct lesions, ERCP may be the preferred route. The management of hilar tumors can often be facilitated by the placement of transhepatic percutaneous catheters which can facilitate both resection, reconstruction, and may serve as a route for administration of local radiation therapy. These tumors are often found to be unresectable because of direct vascular invasion into the portal vein or hepatic arteries. Therefore, selective celiac angiography can be helpful preoperatively to determine if these major adjacent vascular structures are involved with the tumor.",

Cholesterolosis, or a strawberry gallbladder, is manifested by yellow spots visible on the surface of the gallbladder mucosa. This proliferation of foamy macrophages filled with cholesterol in the lamina propria may also result in the formation of polyps called cholesterol polyps. These polyps are thought to result from disturbance in cholesterol metabolism. Other pseudotumors of the gallbladder are inflammatory polyps which are composed of vascular connective tissue stalk with a single layer columnar epithelial cells and have a chronic inflammatory infiltrate. These lesions are not considered to be premalignant and are felt to be the result of chronic inflammation. Adenomas with hyperplasia of the epithelial layer of the gallbladder, like adenomas in other gastrointestinal organs can be sessile or papillary. Carcinoma in situ has been reported in these lesions, and they are thought to be premalignant. The cause of adenomas of the gallbladder is unknown; but most are not associated with the presence of gallstones. An adenomyoma of the gallbladder is a rare intramural mass or nodule. This lesion is characterized by a proliferation of the mucosal epithelium and hypertrophy of the mucosal layers of the gallbladder. Histologically in addition to muscular hypertrophy, invagination of the epithelial mucosa between muscle layers is evidenced. These lesions are also not considered premalignant.",

Unfortunately recognition of a bile duct injury is uncommon during either open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It must be emphasized that should bile leakage be noted or if \"a typical\" anatomy is encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, early conversion to an open technique and prompt cholangiography is imperative. If a segment of accessory duct less than 3 mm has been injured, and cholangiography demonstrates segmental or sub-segmental drainage of the injured ductal system, simple ligation of the injured duct is indicated. If the injured duct is 4 mm or larger, however, it is likely to drain multiple hepatic segments or the entire right or left lobe and thus requires operative repair. If the injured segment of the bile duct is short (< 1 cm) and the two ends can be opposed without tension, an end-to-end anastomosis can be performed with placement of a T-tube through a separate choledochotomy either above or below the anastomosis. For proximal injuries, or if the injured segment of bile duct is greater than 1 cm in length, an end-to-end bile duct anastomosis should be avoided because of the excessive tension that usually exists in these situations. The use of Roux-en-Y jejunal limb is preferable for creation of the anastomosis. Regardless of the type of anastomosis, all repairs at the time of initial operation should involve some form of external drainage either with a T-tube or intraoperatively-placed transanastomotic stent.",

One surgical approach, in patients with a predominant stricture at the hepatic duct bifurcation, is resection of the bifurcation and long-term transhepatic stenting with silastic stents. Results in patients without established cirrhosis are excellent. However, in those patients with secondary biliary cirrhosis present before surgery, perioperative morbidity and mortality have been high and long-term results poor.

        "explanation": "Several principles are associated with successful repair of a biliary stricture. Although many surgeons favor the use of transanastomotic stents, a number of series have reported successful results without the use of such stents. The length of stenting depends upon the location of the stricture. If the injury involves the common bile duct or common hepatic duct at least 2 cm distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, and adequate proximal bile duct mucosa can be defined, the use of long-term biliary stents is not necessary. In these situations transanastomotic stenting for 4–6 weeks postoperatively is adequate. When adequate proximal bile duct is not available for a good mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis, long-term stenting of the biliary-enteric anastomosis with silastic transanastomotic stents for at least a year is recommended. For established strictures, simple excision and end-to-end anastomosis or repair of the damaged duct can rarely be accomplished because of the invariable loss of duct length as a result of fibrosis associated with injury. Thus in almost all cases, hepaticojejunostomy constructed to a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is the preferred procedure. The use of preoperatively-placed transhepatic biliary catheters can aid in the dissection and identification of the biliary tree especially in patients with prior attempts at repair where scarring and fibrosis may be significant. In addition, the biliary catheters can assist in the placement of long-term transanastomotic stents.",

Sepsis must be controlled first with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics, cholangiography with percutaneous biliary drainage and percutaneous or operative drainage of biliary leaks. Once sepsis is controlled, there is no hurry in proceeding with surgical reconstruction of the bile duct stricture. The combination of proximal biliary decompression and external drainage allows most biliary fistulas to be controlled or even closed. At that time the external drains may be removed. The patients can then be discharged to home to allow several months to lapse for resolution of the inflammation in the periportal region and recovery of overall health status.",

The earliest known writing dealing with surgical topics is the Edwin Smith papyrus. In the works of Hippocrates is the first written account of trepanation. During the second half of the nineteenth century, general anesthesia was introduced and the principles of asepsis were developed. These steps were important for all areas of surgery, including neurosurgery. In addition, it became recognized that certain areas of the nervous system were especially important for certain neurologic functions and that intracranial and intraspinal abnormalities might be localized by the history and neurologic examination findings, thus providing a more specific target for neurosurgical exploration through the small bony openings to which surgeons were restricted at the time. Victor Horsley of London was the first surgeon to prepare himself specifically for surgery of the nervous system and to concentrate his efforts in that area.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Diffusion-weighted MR is a new development in MR applications and is sensitive to microscopic motion of water protons (Brownian motion). Initial applications have involved imaging of early stroke and neoplasia. Early evidence also suggests that diffusion-weighted imaging can differentiate tumoral edema from tumor and identify the nonenhancing part of the tumor. Doppler sonography, MRA, and CT angiography (CTA) are all useful for evaluating the stenotic condition of carotid bifurcation noninvasively. However, sonography is very operator dependent, and MRA commonly overestimates the degree of carotid stenosis resulting from the turbulence, dephasing at points of stenosis or irregularity. CTA obtained by spiral or helical CT has a good correlation rate with carotid angiography (92%). Conventional carotid angiography remains the most accurate imaging modality for evaluation of the stenosis of carotid bifurcation. Although CT and MRI have taken the place of myelography in evaluating neurologic diseases, it is still useful in detecting diffuse subarachnoid seeding, which may be difficult to identify on MRI. The bone detail and calcification are poorly identified on MR, so in a patient with facial trauma, CT is a better modality than MR. With MRS, metabolites within a selected region of interest (ROI) can be investigated, and spectral peaks that reflect the concentrations of the metabolite within the ROI can be obtained. The metabolites include lactate, neuronal marker (NAA), phosphorus metabolites, creatine, and choline. Reduction in the NAA level and elevation in lactate level could be noted in acute stroke.",

Cytologic examination of CSF may provide critical diagnostic information in a patient with meningeal carcinomatosis or subarachnoid spread of a primary brain tumor such as a medulloblastoma, but in most instances CSF examination is not of significant value. Furthermore, in a patient with a brain tumor lumbar puncture may be dangerous; it may promote brain herniation. If there has not been a surgical breach of the dura mater, primary brain tumors seldom spread to areas outside the intracranial and intraspinal compartments. Most gliomas, including astrocytomas, cannot be cured by surgical resection. The pilocytic astrocytoma of the cerebellum and the optic nerve glioma are exceptions to that rule. Neoplasms of astrocytic, oligodendroglial, or ependymal origin vary histologically along a spectrum from benign to malignant, with no sharp dividing line.

About 95% of lumbar disc herniations occur at the L5–S1 or L4–L5 level. Approximately 4% occur at the L3–L4 level, and less than 1% at the L2–L3 or L1–L2 level. Sciatica is a term used to refer to pain along the course of the sciatic nerve. A ruptured lumbar disc typically causes low back pain and ipsilateral sciatica. The mechanical signs of a lumbar disc herniation include paravertebral muscle spasm, lumbar scoliosis, tenderness over one or more of the lower lumbar spines, limitation of low back motion, limitation of straight leg raising, and a positive popliteal compression test. Weakness of dorsiflexion of the foot is a neurologic sign, not a mechanical sign. Plain x-ray films of the spine do not demonstrate the presence and location of a lumbar disc herniation except in the rare instance of a calcified disc herniation. Myelography, CT, or MRI is needed to visualize the herniated disc.",

The posterolateral herniated disc can be removed by either a posterior or an anterior approach, but the anterior approach is preferred for the central herniation because the surgeon can remove the ruptured disc without manipulating (and possibly injuring) an already compromised spinal cord. Cervical spondylosis represents a combination in the cervical spine of degenerative disc disease and osteophyte formation (including that from osteoarthritis of the apophyseal joints and the joints of Luschka). The cervical spine contains the joints of Luschka, which are not present elsewhere in the spine. These joints, one on each side of the disc, are separate from the more posteriorly situated facet joints (apophyseal or interpedicular joints). The term cervical myelopathy refers to dysfunction of the cervical portion of the spinal cord. Pain and/or neurologic dysfunction in the distribution of one or more cervical nerve roots is termed cervical radiculopathy.

Recovery does not depend on regeneration and occurs within days or weeks. With neurotmesis there is significant disorganization in the nerve or actual disruption of its continuity, which precludes recovery without surgical repair.

As nerve regeneration progresses, this point moves farther away from the level of the nerve injury. Causalgia is a specific severe pain syndrome that may accompany a partial injury to a mixed peripheral nerve. As compared with primary repair, the extent of damage to a nerve can be better assessed and the correct amount trimmed off, with a secondary repair 3 to 8 weeks after the injury; the epineurium and perineurium are stronger and can be sutured more easily; optimal operating room conditions can be arranged; and there is no time for wallerian degeneration (i.e., the involved neurons are capable immediately of regenerating new distal segments, and the regenerating axons can penetrate the repair site before a significant amount of scar forms). If a clinically nonfunctioning nerve is in continuity when it is explored some weeks after the initial injury the surgeon may find it helpful to stimulate the nerve electrically proximal to the injury and to look distally for evidence of muscle contraction or transmission of nerve action potentials. If there is no evidence of transmission across the area of injury, the injured portion of the nerve should be excised and the cut ends sutured together. If there is transmission across the area of injury, surgical treatment should be limited to external neurolysis. A disrupted nerve should be reapproximated surgically, but only after each end has been trimmed back to healthy fascicles. The trimmed nerve ends must not be under tension when they are sewn together.",

        "explanation": "A brain abscess is a purulent lesion of brain tissue, beginning as a focal infection, usually in the white matter surrounded by a typical inflammatory response. Brain abscesses usually are secondary to focal infection elsewhere. Abscesses that develop by direct intracranial extension are usually solitary and are typically found in the frontal and temporal lobes. Multiple brain abscesses that develop in the septic patient are often related to bacterial endocarditis, pneumonia, and diverticulitis. Abscess formation is frequent among patients with compromised immunity either from an underlying illness or during pharmacologic immunosuppression (i.e., during organ transplantation). Signs and symptoms of brain abscess are related to its mass effect. Headache, focal neurologic deficits, and impaired mentation are often noted. There may be little or no evidence of infection and the patient may be afebrile. Seizures may occur. Intracranial epidural abscesses are quite uncommon and are usually caused by a local extension of osteomyelitis or by hematogenous spread from a distant suppurative focus. In cases of early abscess formation or high surgical risk, medical therapy alone with the appropriate parenteral antibiotic may be sufficient. The most effective therapy is drainage of the purulent material with simultaneous administration of appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Although needle aspiration may be successful, craniotomy with evacuation and removal of the abscess wall may be necessary. Surgical drainage reduces the mass effect, thereby reducing the most critical and dangerous aspect of the infection. It also allows accurate bacteriologic analysis. Despite aggressive surgical and medical management, mortality rates associated with brain abscess approach 40%, especially in the malnourished, chronically debilitated, or immunosuppressed patient.",

        "explanation": "Astrocytomas arise from the glial (stromal or supporting) cells of the brain. These tumors are infiltrative and rarely can be totally excised. High-grade astrocytomas (grades III and IV) are the most common primary intracranial tumor constituting 25% of all intracranial tumors and 50% of all gliomas. For the most part meningiomas are benign tumors that arise from the arachnoid layer of the meninges occurring in the fourth through sixth decades of life. Meningiomas can occur in a variety of sites and together constitute about 17% of intracranial tumors. The treatment for meningiomas is surgical, however, total resection is uncommon, frequently resulting in recurrence. Malignant histologic appearance of meningiomas is far less common than a benign appearance. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from the Schwann cells that surround axons as they leave the CNS by way of the cranial nerves. Schwannomas constitute 8% of all intracranial tumors and are almost twice as common in females as males. Medulloblastomas are part of the primitive neuroectodermal classification of brain tumors. They are thought to arise from primitive cells of the cerebellum, most likely the external granular layer. They constitute 8% of all gliomas. Two-thirds of medulloblastomas occur in children, with the average age of onset being 14 years. They commonly metastasize throughout the subarachnoid space by way of the CSF and are rarely found outside the CNS. Treatment involves aggressive surgical removal of the tumor followed by radiation of the brain. Chemotherapy is commonly used as well. Craniopharyngiomas are histologically benign and arise from nests of squamous cells within the pituitary gland. They may be found in the intrasellar or suprasellar locations but are always along the craniopharyngeal canal. Over 50% occur in the first two decades of life. Although craniopharyngiomas can be cured with surgical removal or controlled with radiation, many of these histologically-benign tumors cannot be removed safely.",

Malignant cells invade the CNS hematogenously and tend to lodge at the grey and white matter junction. Although any malignancy has the potential to metastasize to the brain, the most common primary sites are the lung, breast, kidney, testes, colon, and skin. The presenting symptoms are determined by the site or sites of the metastases. Symptoms commonly include headache, mental status changes, seizures and hemiparesis. In general, a symptomatic solitary lesion that is surgically accessible should be removed if the patient has at least a six-month life expectancy. Surgery should not be undertaken for multiple lesions or in patients who are severely afflicted by their primary disease. Whole brain irradiation is almost always indicated after surgical resection. There is little evidence that chemotherapy plays a significant role. Tumor metastasis to the leptomeninges (meningiocarcinomatosis) is also common particularly in adults with lymphoma, breast, and lung cancer. Patients may present with cranial nerve palsies, radiculopathies, obstructive hydrocephalus. They often have signs and symptoms suggestive of meningitis. Analysis of the CSF is usually critical, often revealing increased opening pressure, elevated white blood cell count and protein levels, and a decreased glucose. Cytology should always be obtained, however it is not universally positive for malignant cells.",

Simple skull fractures (linear, stellate, or comminuted nondepressed) require no specific treatment. They are, however, potentially serious and can be fatal if they cross major vascular channels in the skull, such as the groove of the middle meningeal artery or the dural venous sinuses. Depressed skull fractures often require surgery to elevate the depressed bone fragments. If there are no adverse neurologic signs and the fracture is closed, repair may be done electively. Basal skull fractures involve the floor of the calvarium. Bruising may occur about the eye (raccoon sign) or behind the ear (Battle sign), suggesting a fracture involving either the anterior or middle fossa, respectively. Any associated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), rhinorrhea, or otorrhea should be treated expectantly. Traumatic CSF leaks typically stop within the first 7 to 10 days. Should a leak persist, lumbar CSF drainage can be implemented to seal the leak by lowering CSF volume and intracranial pressure. If this therapy fails, surgical exploration and oversewing of the defect with a facial patch graft is indicated. Less than 5% of patients actually require surgical repair. Prophylactic antibiotics are no longer used since prospective studies have failed to demonstrate any significant benefit from their use.",

        "explanation": "Injuries to the spinal cord can be either complete, resulting in total loss of function below the level of the injury or incomplete which may be manifest in the Brown-Sequard syndrome. This syndrome is manifested by ipsilateral loss of motor function and position-vibratory sensation with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the injury. Anatomically, this presentation is explained by hemisection of the cord. In addition to the neurologic deficit, acute spinal cord injury is accompanied by many systemic responses. Blood pressure is generally low if the cord injury is above the T-5 level. Such an injury effectively denervates the sympathetic nervous system, which leads to increased venous capacitance and decreased venous return. The resulting hypotension is controlled by the administration of intravenous fluids. The goals of treatment of a spinal injury are to correct spinal alignment, to protect undamaged neural tissue, to restore function to irreversibly damaged neural tissue, and ultimately to achieve permanent spinal stability. Reduction and immobilization of any fracture or dislocation must receive top priority to meet these objectives. Cervical spine malalignment can almost always be reduced by skeletal traction. Traction may be applied using skull tongs or halo apparatus. Both are seated percutaneously through the outer table of the skull while the patient is kept supine and immobilized. The indications for early operation on patients with spinal cord injury include the inability to close the fracture or dislocation satisfactorily by closed methods, neurologic deterioration in a patient with initially incomplete cord lesion, and severe compression of the spinal cord by an intraspinal mass shown on myelography or MRI. Either the anterior or posterior approach may be used, depending on the nature of the spine injury and the degree of instability. If cord function is preserved immediately after injury, additional function usually returns if the cord and spine are protected from secondary injury. Patients with complete injuries rarely recover function below the level of the lesion.",

        "explanation": "Herniated lumbar intervertebral discs often produce some degree of nerve compression. The severity of the syndrome depends on the degree of root compression. In the lumbar spine, more than 90% of clinical problems arise from the L-4 to L-5 and L-5 to S-1 intervertebral discs. Diagnosis is based on history of back pain usually with radiation into the buttock, posterior thigh, and calf at both levels. Pain may be exacerbated by coughing, sneezing, or straining. Bending and sitting accentuate the discomfort, whereas lying down characteristically relieves it. Thorough evaluation of back pain is necessary because of the multitude of causes for such symptoms. Plane films of the lumbosacral spine can identify congenital or bony changes. Disc space narrowing is an unreliable sign, however, of symptomatic disease since narrowing of the disc space can occur without clinical symptoms. Myelography can be diagnostic in symptomatic lumbar disc disease, but CT alone delineates the lesion in most cases. MRI has replaced myelography and CT at some centers in the workup of lumbar radiculopathy. With contrast, it can be extremely helpful in previously-operated cases. Initially, medical treatment is indicated in all patients who do not have neurologic deterioration. Bed rest, local heat, analgesics, and skeletal muscle relaxants are usually effective within a few days. Physical therapy and limited exercise often help when the acute episode passes. With an aggressive conservative management, most patients improve sufficiently to return to full activity. Recurrent symptoms may be treated in a similar fashion, often successfully. Surgical treatment is reserved for a patient with acute or progressive neurologic function, chronic disabling pain, or both. The acute onset of weakness or sphincter disturbances constitute an emergency, demanding prompt diagnosis and early operation.",

        "explanation": "Most intracranial aneurysms are congenital, evolving and developing during life. They are typically found at the bifurcation of major vessels of the circle of Willis with over 85% occurring in the carotid or anterior circulation. Up to 20% of patients with aneurysms will have multiple aneurysms. Patients with intracranial aneurysms most commonly present with signs and symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage. In fact, 80% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhages are caused by aneurysm rupture. The patient notes a sudden severe headache commonly followed by neck stiffness and photophobia due to associated meningeal irritation caused by subarachnoid blood. Transient loss of consciousness may occur. Some patients may develop a focal neurologic deficit or become comatose due to acute rise in ICP. The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually made clinically and confirmed either by noting blood within the subarachnoid spaces on CT scan or finding bloody CSF with xanthochromia on a lumbar puncture. The CT scan should be obtained first since it spares the patient an LP and also eliminates the potential risk of brain-stem compression from herniation if an unsuspected mass lesion is present. Complete cerebral angiography is then used to identify and delineate the aneurysm and, at the same time, rule out multiple aneurysms or an associated arterial venous malformation. Once the diagnosis of aneurysmal rupture is confirmed, the patient is placed on a medical regimen to reduce the risk of rebleeding. This includes strict bed rest with the head elevated. Blood pressure is tightly controlled below 150 mm Hg systolic. Careful observation is necessary to watch for signs of raised ICP which may be attributable to delayed hydrocephalus. Anticonvulsants are started for seizure prophylaxis. The ultimate treatment of aneurysms is microsurgical dissection and obliteration, usually by placing a metallic clip on the aneurysm’s neck by way of a craniotomy. The timing of surgery depends on the clinical grade of the patient. Good grade (I and II) patients should undergo operation within 72 hours of rupture. Poor grade (III and IV) should continue intensive medical management until they improve to a lower grade because mortality is higher with higher grades. Surgically accessible unruptured aneurysms should be operated on electively to prevent rupture.",

          "A",
          "B",
          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) contributes to secondary brain injury by reducing cerebral perfusion pressure which, by definition, is the difference between the mean arterial blood pressure and the cerebral venous pressure. For all clinically-relevant purposes, the cerebrovenous pressure is identical to ICP. Thus, when ICP increases and the mean arterial blood pressure remains stable, cerebral perfusion pressure decreases. When cerebral perfusion pressure falls below 70 mm Hg, cerebral blood flow is compromised, producing cerebral ischemia and compounding the primary injury with secondary insult. In studies of head injury mortality, intracranial hypertension appears to be one of the most important factors affecting outcome. For this reason, aggressive management to circumvent cerebral blood flow reduction and secondary injury is imperative. Initial clinical assessment is essential. Although extensive neurologic testing is limited in uncooperative or unresponsive patients, certain features of examination are crucial. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) uses a numerically scored elevated eye-opening and motor behavior, both spontaneously and in response to stimulation. The higher the score generated in assessment, the better the patient’s neurologic status. This scale also provides useful information regarding the ultimate outcome of the head-injured patient. ICP monitoring may be indicated especially in patients with marked depression or deterioration in neurologic function. Comatose patients who require emergent surgery for other injuries should also be monitored, since frequent neurologic assessment is not possible during general anesthesia. The steps in management to prevent ICP elevation include elevation of the head to facilitate venous return. Sedation reduces posturing and reflexively combative activity which both worsen ICP. Hyperventilation keeps arterial carbon dioxide levels between 25 and 28 mm Hg and lowers cerebral blood volume and ICP. Mild dehydration with judicious sodium replacement and prompt treatment of inappropriate secretion of the antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) protects the brain from insult secondary to fluid overload. If ICP remains elevated despite these measures, mannitol, 0.5 to 1 g/kg and furosemide, 0.1 mg/kg can be used to reduce cerebral edema. Deep sedation with narcotics and even the use of paralyzing agents may be helpful. Corticosteroids are occasionally used, but have no proven benefit.",

        "explanation": "Hemorrhage between the inner table of the skull and the dura mater most commonly arises from a tear of the middle meningeal artery or one of its branches that course through a grove in the lateral skull. Arterial bleeding strips the dura from the undersurface of the bone and produces still more bleeding because the small bridging veins from the dura to the skull are torn. The result is an epidural hematoma which may rapidly increase in size and compress the cerebral cortex. An epidural hematoma classically follows a blow to the head which causes a brief period of unconsciousness. After the patient regains consciousness, there may be a lucid interval during which there are no abnormal neurologic symptoms or signs. As the hematoma enlarges, hemispheric compression occurs. With time the medial portion of the temporal lobe is forced over the edge of the tentorium causing compression of the oculomotor nerve and subsequent dilatation of the ipsilateral pupil. Similarly, compression of the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle causes contralateral hemiparesis, which progresses to decerebrate posturing. Coma, fixed and dilated pupils, and decerebration is the classic triad suggestive of transtentorial herniation. Epidural hematomas are curable lesions, but the mortality rate remains high because the severity of the injury is often not recognized early. A patient may be seen during a lucid interval and discharged. Later, the patient becomes unconscious because of progressive brain compression by the expanding hematoma. Because of the danger of misdiagnosis, any patient with a history of a blow to the head leading to a period of unconsciousness should have a CT scan.",

Axonotmesis is a disruption of the axon with presentation of the axon sheath. Wallerian degeneration of the distal axon fragment occurs. Stretched or prolonged compression causes this functional and structural loss. Regeneration of the proximal axon occurs, but functional recovery depends on the associated injuries, the amount of healthy proximal axon remaining after injury, and the age of the patient. Neurotmesis is disruption of both the axon and axon sheath with corresponding loss of function and is caused by transection of a nerve. Regeneration occurs, but function rarely returns to normal. Clinically, sensory motor changes correspond with the peripheral nerve involved. Detailed history and a precise neurologic examination can localize the site of injury with accuracy. EMG is not useful within the first three weeks of injury but is highly effective for monitoring the status of the degeneration and regeneration process that occurs later. Regeneration in a peripheral nerve occurs at 1 mm/day (roughly 1 inch each month), so improvement may not be obvious for months. Factors that adversely affect the return of function include advanced age of the patient, proximal nerve injury, extensive nerve tissue loss, associated soft tissue injury, and mixed sensory motor function. Unfortunately, incomplete neurologic recovery is often the rule.",

CTL can detect antigens derived from cell surface–associated proteins, but in addition can recognize proteins that are normally in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. In fact, the normal location of the protein can be anywhere within the cell. To understand how a CTL can distinguish an antigen from a protein that is normally located within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell, investigators had to determine exactly what was being recognized by the CTL. T cells were found to recognize short linear fragments of processed or even denatured protein. It was found that proteins that were synthesized endogenously were degraded within the cytoplasm into 9– or 10–amino acid long peptides. These peptides were then transported to the endocytoplasmic reticulum and associated with newly synthesized MHC class I molecules. Certain peptides could fit within the MHC class I molecule and were then transported to the cell surface as a complex. It was this complex, consisting of a 9– to 10–amino acid peptide within a MHC class I molecule that was presented to, and recognized by, CD8+ CTL.",

Therapeutic trials have also combined short courses of high-dose systemic IL-2 administration with LAK cell transfer to promote LAK function and viability, with apparently enhanced efficacy. The shortcomings of LAK and IL-2 therapy included a larger degree of toxicity (including pulmonary, renal, and hepatobiliary) with a significant proportion of patients requiring intensive care unit admissions and 2% to 5% treatment-related mortality. Despite this, response rate remained relatively low. Another therapy using in vitro expanded lymphocytes derived from a TIL has been evaluated in clinical trials. In humans, TIL cell lines have been generated by mincing tumor specimens and culturing eluted lymphocytes with high concentrations of IL-2. TIL lines can be expanded to 10 8 to 10 11 cells over 3 to 8 weeks in culture, and some lines appear to function as T cells with lytic specificity for autologous—but not allogeneic—tumor targets, whereas others function as LAK cells and lyse both autologous and allogeneic tumor targets. Adoptive transfer of 5 × 10 10 TIL alone has not been associated with significant toxicity, and administration of 5 × 10 10 TIL cells with concurrent systemic IL-2 has caused toxicities that are attributable to the IL-2.",

Cutaneous melanoma showed the greatest increase at 83%, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and prostate carcinoma followed with increases of about 50%. Only a few cancers declined in incidence over the same interval. Carcinoma of the cervix showed the greatest reduction at 36%, followed by endometrial carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. The reduction in carcinoma of the cervix is likely due to the early detection and treatment of cervical dysplasia resulting from the widespread use of routine cervical cytological screening.",

        "explanation": "Cellular proto-oncogenes are key regulatory components in cell growth, and many proto-oncogenes are expressed during periods of proliferation, development, and differentiation. Abnormal proto-oncogene function or activation may, therefore, result in the deregulated proliferation and dedifferentiation characteristic of the neoplastic state. Various activation mechanisms can change a normal gene into an oncogene. Point mutations (single nucleotide changes in DNA) are one such mechanism. For example, members of the ras gene family are some of the most frequently activated oncogenes in solid human tumors. The ras gene products are plasma membrane proteins capable of binding guanosine triphosphate (GTP). These proteins, called G proteins, are involved in intracellular signal transduction. In tumors with ras activation, the difference in the oncogene compared to the normal gene is a single nucleotide change. Point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the ras protein change a normal protein into one with transforming activity. Another important mechanism of oncogene activation is chromosomal translocation, the shifting of a segment of one chromosome to another chromosome. One of the most well-known examples is the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The proto-oncogene c-abl is translocated from chromosome 9 to the bcr locus on chromosome 22. Transcription of the new bcr/abl locus results in the formation of a fusion protein. This new protein has enhanced tyrosine kinase activity and transforming capabilities. In other tumors, an oncogene may be found in an increased number of gene copies per cell, termed amplification. DNA amplification results in an increased level of gene expression. Amplification of N-myc has been found to correlate with prognosis in patients with neuroblastoma.",

FCM is now widely used clinically to rapidly measure the DNA content and estimate the proliferative rate of normal cells and populations of cells comprising malignancies.

Tumor cells often exhibit gross chromosomal karyotypic changes in both structure and number, which is frequently reflected in a DNA content other than 1 or an even multiple of 1, known as aneuploidy. The clinical application of FCM attempts to identify aggressive populations or subpopulations of tumor cells within a localized primary lesion that may predict early-stage patients at risk for micrometastatic disease. For most solid tumors, it has been difficult to demonstrate the presence of aneuploidy as negative prognostic variables independent from other negative prognostic variables, such as high nuclear grade, vascular or lymphatic invasion, or the presence of regionally involved lymph nodes. There does seem to be a subpopulation of node-negative breast cancer tumors with aneuploidy that are more biologically aggressive other node-negative breast cancers.",

Liver regeneration after hepatic injury or hepatectomy results in both a dramatic hyperplastic response with an increase in cell number and a hypertrophic response with an increase in cell size. Metaplasia is a reversible transformation of one mature cell type to another in a given tissue. Epithelial metaplasia secondary to chronic inflammation has been extensively investigated. In cases of chronic gastroesophageal reflux, the normal distal esophageal squamous cell mucosa may undergo metaplasia to a “gastric-type” columnar epithelium. In the respiratory tract, the normal pseudostratified columnar epithelium may be replaced by squamous cells. Dysplasia is a term usually applied to epithelial tissues, characterized by altered cell size, shape, and organization. Dysplasia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the degree of cellular dedifferentiation. The gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tree, urinary bladder, cervix, vagina, breast, and the skin all may exhibit foci of dysplasia. Nuclear polymorphism and hyperchromatism are present and often accompanied by total loss of cellular and epithelial polarity. Mitoses are more frequently seen in the afflicted areas than in the surrounding normal epithelium. Although disordered growth of superficial tissue is present, there is no penetration of abnormal cells through the epithelial basement membrane. Carcinoma in situ demonstrates all of the above changes, with an increased number of mitoses, but it is still confined by the basement membrane and may be considered the most disordered extreme of dysplasia.",

        "explanation": "Genetic events leading to oncogene activation result in either increased gene expression or increased activity of the oncoprotein. Another distinct class of genes has been described as negative regulators of cell proliferation. These genes have been referred to as tumor-suppressor genes. The loss of these genes allow tumor development by the loss of normal growth-inhibitory signals. Genetic analysis of families with hereditary and sporadic retinoblastomas (Rb) has provided evidence for the role of tumor-suppressor genes in human tumors. In inherited retinoblastomas, an abnormal Rb gene is transmitted to half the offspring. As long as a normal allele is present, the tumor does not develop, and the abnormal germ-line mutation behaves in a recessive fashion; however, a second mutation of the normal allele (somatic cell mutation) may occur in a retinal cell, leading to the development of the tumor. In sporadic retinoblastomas, development of a tumor requires two somatic mutations. The genetic loss in retinoblastomas involves deletion of DNA from chromosome 13q14. Using the technique of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP), tumor suppressor genes may be identified through the loss of heterozygosity of the allele in question or a specific marker associated with that allele. Heterozygosity refers to the presence of two different alleles for a given gene. In the Rb gene example, presence of heterozygosity at the Rb locus prevents tumor development because of the influence of the normal wild-type allele. Loss of this wild-type allele in a second genetic event results in the absence of a normal tumor suppressor gene product and subsequent tumor formation.",

        "explanation": "Evidence for the involvement of tissue-degradative enzymes in neoplastic invasion is convincing. The production and activation of specific tissue-destructive enzymes such as lysosomal hydrolases and collagenases has been documented in tumor invasion. Destruction of host tissue by hydrolytic enzymes, aided by pressure atrophy and the occlusion of blood and lymph vessels by an expanding tumor mass, facilitates infiltration of neoplastic tissue. Histologic examination of tissues obtained from sites of tumor invasion displays considerable variation in the degree of tissue damage, and many human and animal malignant neoplasms express higher levels of lytic enzymes than benign tumors or corresponding normal tissues. Lysosomal catheptic activities are elevated within some tumor tissues, and increased production of cathepsin B in breast carcinomas has been observed compared with that in normal or benign tissue. Enhanced production and secretion of the serine protease plasminogen activator has been associated with the neoplastic transformation of a variety of cell types. Both intravasation and extravasion are pivotal in hematogenous, systemic metastasis. In either instance, the tumor cells are confronted with a barrier significantly comprised of type IV collagen. Type IV collagen is a major structural protein of basement membranes between parenchymal cells and the connective tissue on which cells rest. A strong correlation exists between the ability of murine tumor cells to produce spontaneous metastases and their ability to produce increased levels of collagenase IV. Tumor cells that invade blood vessels or leave capillaries of distant organs in which they have lodged must penetrate the basement membrane. Dissolution of the basement membrane, suggestive of enzymatic action, has been observed in areas adjacent to arrested tumor cells.",

        "explanation": "In chemotherapy regimens, it is important not only to deliver adequate doses with each treatment cycle but also to deliver them in a timely fashion. The interval between each treatment cycle is determined by the toxic effects experienced by normal tissues and the amount of time required for resolution of the effects. The scheduling of treatment courses is crucial. If a course follows too closely upon the preceding one, additive toxicities are noted, much to the detriment of the patient, and often the ability to deliver further therapy is at least temporarily compromised. For most agents, the dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression, usually leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Nadir blood counts are reached approximately 14 days after the initiation of each cycle and begin to improve 3 to 5 days later, often with complete resolution by day 28. The resiliency of the bone marrow reserve is dependent upon prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Agents such as busulfan, mitomycin C, procarbazine, and the nitrosoureas display delayed myelosuppression, often up to four weeks after the initiation of therapy and lasting several weeks. Therapy with these drugs may be delivered only every 6–8 weeks; in addition, therapy with these agents may lead to chronic cumulative myelosuppression and, in some cases, marrow failure.",

Such resistance, a function separate from the state of proliferation of the malignant cells, has been termed multidrug resistance. This form of resistance is mediated by the cell surface protein, P-glycoprotein, a product of the MDR-1 gene. A magnesium-dependent ATPase, P-glycoprotein acts as a transmembrane efflux pump and appears to serve as a cellular detoxifier and possibly as a chloride pump. P-glycoprotein causes the extrusion of diverse agents such as anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, Vinca alkaloids, and actinomycins out of the cell before they are able to reach their intracellular targets. The protein is normally found on the luminal surface of such organs as the colon and rectum, small intestine, proximal tubules of the kidney, and gravid uterus; the acinar and bile canalicular surfaces of pancreatic and hepatic parenchymal cells, respectively; and in cells of the adrenal cortex, where there is no polarity to the cell surface location. P-glycoprotein has likewise been found in tumors derived from these organs. P-glycoprotein can be induced in vitro by exposing cell lines to increasing concentrations of various agents, a phenomenon which also extends to tissues and cell lines not known to normally express significant amounts of P-glycoprotein, such as melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and adenocarcinoma of the breast.",

At the time of any given dose, only a fraction of cells will be in a vulnerable position within the cell cycle. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the tumor versus normal tissue depends on the ability of cells to redistribute and repopulate within the radiated volume. In tumors that are particularly radiosensitive, this balance between cell killing and repopulation favors the normal tissues over the tumor. The ability to recruit cells from adjacent undamaged areas should also favor normal tissues. The presence or absence of molecular oxygen greatly influences the proportion of cells killed by a given dose of radiation. The availability of oxygen is clearly the most important factor for enhancing the formation and prolonging the survival of free radicals. Therefore, radiosensitivity of cells within a given tumor varies based on their location relative to oxygen-carrying capillaries. Cells in hypoxic regions of a tumor may escape the effects of radiation.

Adenoviruses have been isolated from a variety of animal tumors; most of these are tumorigenic in newborn animals. An example of the herpesvirus group is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which has been implicated in the etiologies of Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The World Health Organization has indicated that previous and continued exposure to EBV results in high titers of antibody to the virus capsid antigen and a 30-fold increase in risk compared with control populations. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the etiologic agent of genital herpes. Infected women with early sexual activity and a large number of sexual partners have significantly increased risk for cervical carcinoma. Women with invasive carcinoma have antibodies to HSV-2, and about 40% of cervical biopsies with severe dysplasia or carcinoma display HSV-2-specific DNA-binding protein. A similar relation has been established for human papovavirus.",

Difficulties in efficiently transducing certain target cell populations may be due to low levels or absence of appropriate virus receptors. A second requirement for efficient retroviral gene integration is the process of cell proliferation. The dependence of integration on mitosis is thought to be due to the need for nuclear membrane breakdown to enable the viral integration complex to enter the nucleus. Production is another problem, as retrovirus particles are relatively labile when compared to other viruses. In general, retroviruses cannot be purified without significant loss of infectivity.",

Homozygotes have only 15 to 20% of the normal plasma levels of a-1-AT. Defects in normal a-1-antitrypsin expression and processing, brought about as a result of mutation, can lead to pathology in the lung and liver. Diminished levels of a-1-AT in the blood result in an imbalance between proteases and protease inhibitors, allowing destruction of lung parenchyma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the most common clinical manifestation of a-1-AT deficiency, with basal lung parenchyma most severely affected. The liver is the primary site of a-1-AT biosynthesis. In some cases, alteration in the protein sequence of a-1-AT prevents normal post-translational processing and results in the intracellular accumulation of large quantities of abnormal protein, detectable as intracytoplasmic inclusions. One pathologic consequence of abnormal protein accumulation is the development of liver injury.",

The concerted activities of the early genes contribute to initiation of the late phase of viral replication whose hallmark is the onset of DNA replication. Adenoviral mRNA undergoes extensive post-transcriptional processing, leading to expression of five sets of late proteins comprising structural components of the virion.

The fluid is urinated back out into the amniotic pool by the fetal kidneys and a functioning bladder. Although there are maternal causes of polyhydramnios (cardiac failure, renal failure, other causes of fluid retention) and some idiopathic cases, many instances are related to the presence of fetal anomalies. These include central nervous system problems such as anencephaly, which prevents normal swallowing, and any high alimentary tract obstruction that blocks the passage of the amniotic fluid and prevents its absorption (including esophageal atresia, pyloric atresia, and duodenal atresia). In addition, infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have obstructions due to herniation of the stomach and bowel into the thoracic cavity. This is a poor prognostic finding in these infants.

The normal PaO 2 below the ductus, as measured through an umbilical artery catheter, would be between 60 and 80 mm. Hg. Surfactant levels do not approach normal until after the 34th week of gestation, when enzyme levels in the surfactant pathway mature. Amniocentesis is performed to measure the lethicin-to-sphingomyelin ratio (L:S ratio) and determine whether maturation has occurred. Fluid requirements in the premature infant are between 140 and 150 ml. per kg. per day in comparison with those of the normal neonate in whom 80 ml. per kg. per day would be adequate. Increased insensible losses and the need for overhead warmers play a role in this increase. Axillary or skin probe temperature monitoring is more accurate than the rectal temperature in the neonate. The rectal temperature is not a good indicator of core body temperature until approximately 18 months of age. Premature infants lack immunoglobulin A (IgA) and have low levels of IgM, the C3b component of complement, and decreased opsonins. In addition, the leukocytes have reduced phagocytic ability, creating an increased risk of infection. Escherichia coli and beta-hemolytic streptococcus are the two most common infectious agents affecting the neonate.",

The obstruction is related to intraluminal concretions of abnormal meconium. The treatment of choice is adequate hydration and evacuation with a hypertonic gastrograffin enema. The hyperosmolar contrast material causes an outpouring of fluids into the bowel lumen, which flushes out the obstructing meconium and negates the need for laparotomy. Observation alone is not a useful method of treatment. When gastrograffin evacuation fails, laparotomy, placement of a pursestring suture in the bowel wall, and intraluminal irrigation with saline and gastrograffin (administered through a catheter inserted through a small enterotomy within the pursestring) will often clear the obstructing meconium. This obviates the need for resection or enterostomy in most cases. Postoperatively, a sweat chloride test should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

It may be superior or inferior to the hyoid and is occasionally slightly off the midline. Because the thyroglossal cyst may rarely contain the patient’s only thyroid tissue, some have recommended a technetium-99m radioisotope thyroid scan before excision. However, excision of the cyst is indicated regardless, because infection of the cyst is likely, and the dysgenetic thyroid tissue in the cyst has malignant potential. For these reasons, patients with suspected thyroglossal duct cysts require routine surgical excision. Preoperative ultrasound, thyroid scan, T3 and T4 levels, or needle aspiration is not necessary. For those patients who have thyroid tissue in their cysts by pathologic examination, postoperative thyroid function tests identify those who have no remaining thyroid tissue and replacement therapy can be prescribed.",

Fifteen to 25% of infants with a diaphragmatic hernia have an associated anomaly, the most important being cardiovascular abnormalities. Although ventricular septal defects and aortic coarctations are most common, virtually all cardiac and great vessel anomalies have been reported.

        "explanation": "The preferred approach for esophageal atresia with a distal tracheoesophageal fistula in a patient without other problems is an extrapleural right thoracotomy with division of the tracheoesophageal fistula and primary esophagostomy. No gastrostomy is ordinarily used. The results with this approach are better than those with a staged approach. Three major complications are related to the esophageal anastomosis: leak, stricture and recurrent fistula. The incidence of leak varies from 10% to 20% depending on the type of anastomosis done and the degree of tension. A distinct advantage of an extrapleural anastomosis is the predictable resolution of these leaks if adequately drained. Similarly, the stricture rate varies between 10% and 25%, again depending on the type of anastomosis done. Many infants require one or two dilations, but few have significant long-term problems. The incidence of recurrent esophageal fistula is difficult to determine since few authors emphasize this technical problem, but it appears to be about 10% in most reports. Gastroesophageal reflux secondary to dysmotility of the distal esophagus is a significant problem and occurs to some degree in virtually all of these patients. A significant number of these infants, 25% to 30% or more, are refractory to medical therapy and require surgical fundoplication. Tracheomalacia is a complication of the malformation, not of the repair. This appears to result from inadequate cartilagenous tracheal rings at the level of the fistula. The reported incidence is up to 25% in some recent series. Most infants with tracheomalacia improve with growth and time, but a small percentage develop severe respiratory difficulty which requires surgical aortopexy.",

The use of additional imaging provides definitive diagnosis and allows planning for the surgical approach as well. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can separate cystic from solid components in a radiopaque lung mass. These are the most definitive diagnostic studies available. The MRI has reconstructive capabilities that obviate the need for angiography. Intravenous contrast with CT scan provides similar anatomic information. Ultrasonography is less costly, more readily performed and in select cases may be as sensitive. Angiography is not employed regularly because these alternative imaging strategies provide similar information at lower cost with less morbidity. A barium esophagogram is helpful in the diagnosis of children with dysphagia but that is a rare presentation for these lesions. Bronchoscopy is rarely helpful for these lesions and in these infants and small children carries the risk of general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation. In children with congenital lobar emphysema and cystic adenomatoid malformation, hyperinflation following positive pressure may induce mediastinal compression and create a surgical emergency.

Because effective preoperative decompression of the intestine is usually possible and because it has become clear that the underlying pulmonary hypoplasia is not reversed by emergency operation, this sense of urgency is no longer accepted. Most surgeons now commit themselves to a period of preoperative stabilization which is used to confirm the diagnosis and optimize medical care. The current recommendation is that operative repair be undertaken in a stable patient who is nearing extubatable levels of ventilatory support, regardless of the means of support which have been employed. This means that repair is done at or after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass in infants where that is necessary. The results with a delayed approach appear at least equivalent and in several series better than with emergent or early repair. The concept is that the deferral of the iatrogenic operative injury to a time when the neonatal pulmonary vascular bed is less vulnerable to vasospasm is desirable.",

Typically, malrotation produces an incomplete obstruction of the duodenum with a corkscrew or coiled appearance in the third or fourth portions of the duodenum. Malposition of the duodenojejunal junction is diagnostic. In particular, this includes a location to the right of the midline. Additionally, failure to achieve normal posterior and cephalad fixation is typical. The small bowel resides in the right abdomen and the colon and cecum are on the left. Attempts to radiographically differentiate malrotation with or without volvulus are unreliable and therefore hazardous. This child has gastroesophageal reflux which is likely secondary to the partial duodenal obstruction from malrotation. None of the alternatives other than emergency laparotomy are appropriate. There is no role for nonoperative management of malrotation in the neonate. Assessment, resuscitation and preoperative preparation should be conducted concurrently as the child is prepared for laparotomy. This urgency is because a delay measured in hours may represent the difference between a viable or infarcted midgut at laparotomy. Fifty to 75% of malrotations are discovered in the first month of life and about 90% occur in children less than one year of age.",

Because this syndrome is not always apparent during the physical examination, a routine karyotype should be obtained. A preoperative ECHO ultrasound examination is also appropriate to evaluate the possibility of associated congenital heart disease. Feeding intolerance and bilious vomiting in the first 24 to 48 hours of life are characteristic. The malformations are typically distal to the ampulla of Vater and thus the infants present with bilious vomiting and proximal duodenal and gastric distention. Malformations proximal to the ampulla of Vater result in nonbilious vomiting and this possibility must not be ignored. Generally, bypass of the obstructing lesion is the best approach regardless of whether an atresia or annular pancreas is responsible. Division of an annular pancreatic band is inappropriate for two reasons: 1) The duodenum is virtually always atretic in addition. 2) Division of this pancreatic tissue necessarily divides the accessory pancreatic duct within it creating the real possibility of a pancreatic fistula. Generally, the construction of a duodenostomy that minimizes the length of defunctionalized duodenum is preferred. The procedure generally employed is a diamond-shaped duodenostomy. Simple duodenojejunostomy without a Roux-en-Y is occasionally necessary for lesions in the distal duodenum. Diamond-shaped duodenoduodenostomy.",

Typically it occurs in critically ill, preterm infants and is characterized by abdominal distention, bilious vomiting and either occult or gross blood in the stool. In this setting, pneumotosis intestinalis is pathognomonic. When the diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds and the plain film, no contrast imaging should be done as this may complicate or contribute to the problems of perforation. In particular, the child presented here has an unequivocal history and an upper GI series would be inappropriate. Half of all infants with NEC have birth weights less than 1500 g, and 80% of these infants weigh less than 2500 g at birth. The incidence is approximately 1 to 2 in 1000 live births. It is the most common surgical emergency in neonates in North America. The initial management of infants with NEC consists of nasogastric decompression; broad-spectrum antibiotic administration; and correction of hypoxemia, hypotension, acidosis, fluid or electrolyte disorders, and other reversible medical problems. Up to 90% of infants with NEC can be managed successfully nonoperatively, but this is widely variable among institutions because of differences in referral and practice patterns. Intestinal perforation is characterized by pneumoperitoneum and is an indication for operation. Although the incidence of perforation is variable, it is generally less than 20% to 40%. The overall survival rate for neonates with NEC is about 60% to 70% for both operative and nonoperative management groups. This represents a substantial improvement from the 20% to 30% survival probability when the entity was first recognized 30 to 40 years ago.",

Some 10% to 20% of infants with CF present initially with meconium ileus. All infants with meconium ileus have cystic fibrosis. CF is characterized by a transport defect of epithelium that results in impermeability of the chloride ion and therefore water. Inspissated secretions in the pancreas and gut lead to obturator obstruction of the terminal ileum from meconium in the neonate. Approximately two-thirds of these infants have simple meconium ileus, the remainder have complications such as proximal volvulus, perforation or atresia. These latter problems may be associated with the development of a meconium cyst. In this instance, speckled calcifications on plain radiograph or ultrasound are diagnostic. The film above is that of a meconium pseudocyst consistent with intraperitoneal spillage of meconium from intestinal perforation. This finding requires surgical exploration. Sixty to 70% of infants with simple meconium ileus can be treated by enema installation of one several irrigation solutions into the obstructed terminal ileum. Saline, hyperosmolar contrast agents, dilute N-acetylcysteine and a variety of other solutions have been used successfully. Following resolution of the obstruction, most institutions now report survival rates as high as 70% to 100%. The average life expectancy for CF patients is now well into the third decade of life.

There is an intrahepatic component as well.

The approach for the usual infant in whom biliary atresia is discovered within the first 90 days of life is to confirm the suspected diagnosis by operative cholangiogram at laparotomy and then proceed with portoenterostomy. In general terms, one-third of these infants do well on a long-term basis, one-third have prompt failure, and the remainder have chronic liver disease that becomes problematic more slowly. Therefore, approximately two-thirds of these patients develop chronic liver disease for which liver transplantation is a reasonable alternative. Hepatic transplantation is best considered a necessary and complementary approach to portoenterostomy for infants with biliary atresia. Data support its use in infants with failed portoenterostomy or in older infants with established cirrhosis at the time of presentation.

        "explanation": "The incidence of Hirschprung’s disease is about 1 per 5000 live births, with no racial predilection, but with a marked male-to-female (4:1) preponderance. Most cases are sporadic, but long-segment or total colonic aganglionosis and female gender are strongly associated with familial disease. Recent data suggest an association with the RET protooncogene. The genetic basis of Hirschprung’s disease is under active investigation and it appears that several genes including those located on chromosomes 10, 13, 22 and possibly others are involved. It is neither sex linked nor dominant. There is a rare association with the MEN syndromes, particularly medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The accuracy of suction rectal biopsy is 100% with a correctly done biopsy that includes submucosa and experienced pediatric pathology in several large series. This requires both a search for ganglion cells and evaluation of the axons of the myenteric neurons using either conventional staining techniques or histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase. Definitive operations for congenital aganglionosis all depend on resection or bypass of the distal aganglionic rectum with a low rectal anastomosis to normally innervated pulled-through proximal intestine. Selection among the several described operations depends more on a surgeon’s individual training and preference rather than upon demonstrable differences in outcome. Although the endorectal pull-through is one of the widely practiced and popular procedures, it is not demonstrably superior to the procedures described by Duhamel or Swenson (see text). Eighty to 90% or more of patients have excellent or normal bowel function following reconstructive surgery for Hirschprung’s disease when evaluated after 5 years, regardless of the procedure employed. The primary remaining cause of mortality directly attributable to Hirschprung’s disease itself is enterocolitis. When it occurs, this is typically found in infants or neonates for whom the diagnosis has been delayed. Postoperative enterocolitis does occur, but it tends to be substantially less virulent. Undiagnosed neonatal Hirschprung’s enterocolitis can lead to death in 12 to 24 hours from overwhelming sepsis.",

These cysts typically involve the entire common bile duct with only mild dilation of the common hepatic duct and a normal intrahepatic system. The treatment of this lesion is always surgical. Internal drainage procedures without cyst resection (e.g., cyst duodenostomy, cyst gastrostomy and cyst jejunostomy) were routinely performed for type I choledochal cysts until the 1970s. The rate of failure (e.g., stricture, recurrent cholangitis, stone formation, pancreatitis) ranged from 30% to 75%, depending on the length of follow-up and the type of procedure. As these late complication rates became apparent, the risk of bile duct adenocarcinoma in the residual cyst also became widely recognized. Therefore, the preferred operative treatment of a type I choledochal cyst is total transmural excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.

Fifty to 70% of childhood acute pancreatitis is either idiopathic or posttraumatic in origin. Trauma is the single most common cause of acute pancreatitis in childhood. Cholelithiasis is an important etiology in the adolescent population and in children with hemotologic disorders. Annular pancreas normally is associated with duodenal atresia and produces neonatal duodenal obstruction, but not acute pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum is an anatomic variation present in 10% to 15% of normal children that is occasionally the cause of acute pancreatitis. Valproic acid is an important anti-convulsant used in pediatric neurology. One of its possible complications is the development of acute pancreatitis or necrotizing pancreatitis. Fortunately, this is rare as it is often lethal.",

        "explanation": "Gastroschisis is a full-thickness defect of the abdominal wall with herniation of a variable amount of uncovered intestine. Prenatal diagnosis has enabled the diagnosis of gastroschisis to be made prior to delivery. Prospective evaluation comparing vaginal delivery with elective cesarean section has demonstrated no difference in outcome. Therefore, careful vaginal delivery generally remains the birthing method of choice. Unlike omphalocele which is commonly associated (50%) with other anomalies, other structural anomalies are associated with gastroschisis in approximately 10% of patients. Primary fascial closure after reduction of the herniated viscera is the best surgical option and this is possible in 60% to 70% of infants. Care must be taken not to generate excessive intraabdominal pressure when performing a primary abdominal wall closure. Generally, an intraabdominal pressure less than 20 cm H2O is well tolerated. If the herniated viscera cannot be reduced primarily, a silastic pouch constructed to temporarily contain the extra abdominal bowel and a series of partial reductions are begun. This approach combined with adequate nutritional support by total parenteral nutrition yields survival rates of at least 80% to 90% in most contemporary series of gastroschisis.",

Meconium ileus and Hirschprung’s disease are classical causes of neonatal intestinal obstruction outlined in the table. Incarcerated inguinal hernias are the most common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction. Hernias usually do not present a diagnostic dilemma, as simple inspection of the groin yields an obvious diagnosis. Intussusception, while a cause of distal bowel obstruction in infants, does not usually become a consideration until at least 3 to 6 months of age. Intestinal obstruction related to Meckel’s diverticulum is generally related to either intussusception or volvulus associated with a band from the Meckel’s diverticulum to the abdominal wall.

        "explanation": "Most cases of hyperinsulinemia in the first 2 years of life are due to nesidioblastosis, a condition associated with excessive and diffuse formation of neoislets from primitive pancreatic ductal cells. Hyperinsulinemia secondary to islet cell adenoma or carcinoma or islet cell hyperplasia is more common in the older child. Infants with nesidioblastosis, such as the one described here, typically present with symptomatic hypoglycemia, seizures and hyperinsulinemia. An insulin-to-glucose ratio (insulin in IU/ml divided by glucose in mg/dL) that is greater than 0.5 with fasting is highly suggestive. Infants with nesidioblastosis are managed initially medically with maintenance of blood glucose levels above 40 mg/dL. This is best carried out by the infusion of hypertonic glucose solutions through a permanent central venous catheter. In addition, diazoxide, cortisone and adrenocorticotropic hormone and streptozocin have been used to treat the hypoglycemia. Definitive management of nesidioblastosis may require pancreatic resection. This requires a pancreatectomy usually estimated at approximately 95% to 99% with splenic and duodenal preservation. Following 90% to 95% pancreatectomy, over 90% of infants with nesidioblastosis are rendered permanently euglycemic. A CT scan of the abdomen to search for an adenoma is an appropriate diagnostic maneuver, but it is not the first priority.",

A successful outcome is expected in over 90% of patients. Neonatal Wilm’s tumor is exceedingly rare and does not ordinarily present with obstruction of a functioning kidney, but rather as a solid mass. Multicystic dysplastic kidney occurs in about 1 in 4000 births and is usually unilateral.

On the contrary, in an infant with hypospadias, chordee, significant penoscrotal webbing, or other congenital problems, circumcision should be discouraged to preserve the foreskin for use in later reconstruction. In normal infants, circumcision is a matter of family choice and not an important issue for medical debate. Phimosis is a fibrotic contraction of the preputial aperture so that retraction is impossible. Circumcision or dorsal slit are the most effective solutions to phimosis.

The N-myc oncogene, whose function and mechanism of action remain the subject of investigation, was empirically shown to be a useful predictor of survival and risk. It was found that patients with increased copies of the N-myc gene had a much worsened prognosis. Currently, most authorities consider a copy number of more than ten to be significant. The trk proto-oncogene is a component of the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor and is expressed in human neuroblastoma tissue.

It has a similar age distribution as that observed in Wilms’ tumor, but a markedly worsened prognosis. It is characterized by a proclivity to metastasize to bones and indeed has been called the bone metastasizing renal tumor of childhood. Relapse and death occur in 75% of patients with over half dying within one year of diagnosis. Aggressive systemic chemotherapy is recommended for all stages of the disease. Likewise, postoperative radiation to the tumor bed is recommended regardless of stage. Rhabdoid tumors are rare malignancies that most commonly involve the kidney in childhood but may also occur primarily in the mediastinum or brain. Outcome is particularly poor and there is no proven chemotherapy regimen. Rhabdoid tumors of the kidney occur in infancy with a median age at presentation of 13 months. Survival rates are almost zero and even Stage I patients fare poorly. Aggressive therapy is warranted including surgical resection, local radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy.",

Over half of patients presenting with symptoms are under the age of 2.

The usual source of the bleeding is a chronic acid-induced ileal ulcer in the ileum adjacent to a Meckel's diverticulum that contains gastric mucosa. Another common symptom associated with a Meckel's diverticulum is intestinal obstruction. The cause of this obstruction may be volvulus of the small bowel around a diverticulum associated with a fibrotic band attached to the abdominal wall, intussusception, or rarely, incarceration of the diverticulum in an inguinal hernia (Littre's hernia). Volvulus is usually an acute event and if allowed to progress, may result in strangulation of the involved bowel.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Carcinoid tumors should be treated by resection, regardless of the presence of metastases, because growth of the primary neoplasm is slow and local complications, such as obstruction and intussusception, are frequent. At clinical discovery a large percentage (as many as 70%) of small-intestinal carcinoids are metastatic to lymph nodes and/or liver. All tumors should be managed by wide en bloc resection, regardless of the size of the primary lesion or the presence of distant metastases. Lesions in the distal ileum require ileocolectomy. Appendiceal tumors larger than 1.5 cm. should be treated by ileocolectomy. The incidence of metastases depends on the size and location of the primary tumor. Appendiceal carcinoid tumors smaller than 1.5 cm. are rarely malignant and may be treated safely by routine appendectomy. This is not true of larger tumors. Like carcinoid tumors elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, the malignancy potential of rectal carcinoid tumors is directly proportional to their size. Tumors smaller than 1 cm. have little or no malignant potential and may be treated by endoscopic excision. Tumors measuring 1 to 2 cm. should be excised operatively with margins, but when they are larger than 2 cm. rectal carcinoid tumors may require anterior resection. In patients with ileal carcinoid tumors, the evidence of a second tumor has been reported as high as 40%.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Carcinoid syndrome occurs when venous drainage from the tumor gains access to the systemic circulation, escaping hepatic degradation. Although hepatic metastases are most often responsible, retroperitoneal metastases and bronchial, ovarian, and testicular carcinoid tumors can also cause the carcinoid syndrome. Serotonin is thought to be largely responsible for both the diarrhea and the fibrosing cardiac lesions associated with the carcinoid syndrome. The vasomotor changes, however, are mediated by kinins and such vasoactive peptides as substance P, neuropeptide K, neurokinin A, and neurotensin. Other substances, such as histamine, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and prostaglandins, may also contribute to systemic manifestations in the carcinoid syndrome. Foregut carcinoid tumors, of which stomach and bronchial tumors are the most common, can cause atypical carcinoid syndrome. It is thought that these tumors are deficient in the enzyme dopa-decarboxylase and have impaired conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) into 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), leading to secretion of 5-HTP into the vascular compartment. Some of the 5-HTP is converted into 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in extrarenal sites, and some is decarboxylated in the kidney and excreted into the urine as 5-HT; but some of the 5-HTP is excreted directly into the urine. Thus, in patients with foregut tumors, the urine contains relatively little 5-HIAA (but more than normal) but large amounts of 5-HTP and 5-HT, in contrast to patients with midgut carcinoid tumors in which large amounts of 5-HIAA are secreted into the urine but relatively little 5-HTP. Carcinoid tumors of the hindgut contain no argentaffin or argyrophil cells, they have no secretory products, and therefore they are not associated with the carcinoid syndrome. The long-acting somatostatin analog provides the best symptomatic therapy, because somatostatin inhibits both release and action of humoral mediators of the carcinoid syndrome. By contrast, serotonin antagonists are of little value and the efficacy of interferon therapy has yet to be established.",

Small bowel x-ray series, using barium contrast, can give very useful information on mucosal abnormalities, enteric fistulas, mechanical obstructions, and very importantly, intestinal motility and transit time.",

Energy needs are unaltered. Gastric secretion and hyperacidity are directly related to the extent of small bowel resection and is due in part to increased concentrations of gastrin in the serum. H 2 blockers are effective in reducing acidity and volume of gastric secretions. Hyperoxaluria develops owing to binding of calcium to fat in the diet with steatorrhea, leaving less to bind with dietary oxalate. The soluble oxalate is absorbed by the colon and excreted in the urine. If oxalate is excessive, oxalate kidney stones can form. With fat malabsorption due to bile salt depletion and rapid intestinal transit, absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, E, K, and D is reduced. Even with oral supplementation, deficiencies can develop.",

In humans the cycle lasts about 90 to 120 minutes. Each phase passes in sequence along the bowel, and when the terminal ileum is reached, the process resumes in the proximal gut. This interdigestive cycle is interrupted and replaced by rapid spiking activity (similar to phase II) when the gut receives a food bolus.

The third and fourth portion of the duodenum complete the duodenal sweep. Mobilization of the duodenum from the retroperitoneum for a multitude of abdominal procedures can be facilitated by the Kocher maneuver where the retroperitoneal attachment is divided and the duodenum and head of the pancreas can be brought out of its retroperitoneal position. Endoscopically, the major papilla of the duodenum can be seen entering at the mid-point of the second portion of the duodenum. The papilla (ampulla of Vater) appears anatomically as a hooded fold, marking the confluence of the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung) and is surrounded by the muscular sphincter of Oddi. In some 50% to 60% of patients, an accessory pancreatic duct (the duct of Santorini) can be seen entering the duodenum proximal to the ampulla of Vater. Endoscopically, this lesser, or minor, papilla appears as a one-to-three mm sessile polyp. The jejunum is the portion of the small bowel that courses from the ligament of Treitz to an arbitrary point approximately two-fifths of the distance to the ileocecal valve. The length of the jejunum has been estimated at 100 cm although this distance can vary dramatically depending on the status of the small intestine. The jejunum is the widest portion of the small intestine, and the diameter progressively decreases as the ileocecal valve is approached.

        ],
        "explanation": "The endocrine functions of the small intestine are diverse with an ever increasing number of hormones, peptides, neurotransmitters, and paracrine substances identified. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is produced by cells located primarily in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum and released in response to luminal fats and proteins. After CCK release from the duodenum and jejunum, the gallbladder contracts and the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, emptying bile into the duodenum. Secretin is found in the S cells of the duodenum and jejunum. Secretin, a true hormone, is released in response to acid in the duodenum when luminal pH falls below 4.5. Intraduodenal secretion of pancreatic bicarbonate neutralizes duodenal pH and results in diminished release of secretin. CCK acts in a synergistic fashion with secretin to stimulate pancreatic exocrine function. Motilin is a 22-amino acid peptide localized in the enterochromaffin cells of the mucosa of the upper small intestine. Motilin likely has a physiologic role in the regulation of the migrating motor complex (MMC). Motilin is released during the fasting state, and increased levels correspond with the onset of the MMC. Neurotensin is a 13-amino acid neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system and in the gut. Specific endocrine cells that contain neurotensin are found in the ileal mucosa with smaller quantities found in the jejunum, stomach, duodenum, and colonic mucosa. Neurotensin is released by a mixed meal and fats, with carbohydrates and protein releasing much smaller increments. It has been proposed that neurotensin has a physiologic role in fat-initiated changes in gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying, pancreatic secretion, and intestinal motility.",

The reabsorption process of bile is both passive and active. Passive absorption occurs along the entire length of the small bowel and depends on the lipid solubility of the bile salt. Glycine bile conjugates are more soluble than taurine conjugates. As much as 50% of bile is passively reabsorbed. Active absorption of bile occurs only in the terminal ileum. A small amount of bile escapes into the colon, where it is deconjugated by bacteria, promoting lipid solubility and further passive absorption.

        "explanation": "The jejunum is the site of maximum absorption of all ingested materials expect for vitamin B12. Although its mucosa contains numerous specific transport processes, the presence of large intercellular pores produces a permeable membrane and allows for rapid passive transfer or solutes and water. The ileum is less permeable and makes greater use of active-transport mechanisms. Normally about 1 to 1.5 liters of water is ingested each day with another 5 to 10 liters secreted by the GI tract in some form. About 80% of this fluid is absorbed by the small bowel. Because of this large bidirectional movement of water, a small alteration in bowel permeability or transport can rapidly result in net secretion and diarrheal disease states. A major source of caloric nutrition comes in the form of carbohydrate. In the Western diet, this is made up primarily of starch (about 60%), sucrose (30%), and lactose (10%). The digestive process for starch begins with digestion of the polysaccharide first by salivary amylase and continues with pancreatic amylase yielding smaller oligosaccharides which along with sucrose and lactose are then presented to the brush border of the jejunum to complete the digestion and absorptive processes. Dietary fiber consists of nondigestible carbohydrate, such as cellulose. Fiber is found commonly in all-bran cereals, beans, partially cooked vegetables, and raw pulpy fruits. High fiber diets retain water within the bowel lumen and significantly shorten bowel transit time. Dietary fiber can absorb organic materials such as bile salts and lipids and inorganic materials such as zinc, calcium, magnesium and iron.",

In the setting of acute pain and anxiety, patients with intestinal obstruction may swallow excessive amounts of air. Fluid accumulates intraluminally with open-or closed-loop small intestinal obstruction due to a number of factors. Experimental studies and clinical investigations demonstrate that elevation of luminal pressures above 20 cm H2O inhibits absorption and stimulates secretion of salt and water into the lumen proximal to an obstruction. In closed-loop obstruction, luminal pressures may exceed 50 cm H2O and may account for a substantial proportion of a luminal fluid accumulation. In simple, open-loop obstruction, distention of the lumen by gas rarely leads to a luminal pressure higher than 8–12 cm H2O. Thus, in open-loop obstruction, the contributions of high luminal pressures to hypersecretion may not be important. In response to heightened luminal pressure, total blood flow to the bowel may initially increase. Subsequently, however, blood flow to the bowel is compromised as luminal pressures increase, bacteria invade, and inflammation leads to edema within the bowel wall. Accumulation of gas and fluid in the obstructed lumen also leads to changes in myoelectrical function in the gut, proximal and distal to the obstructed segment. In response to distension, the obstructed segment itself may dilate, a process known as “receptive relaxation.” At sites proximal and distal to the obstruction, changes in myoelectrical activity are time-dependent. Initially, there may be intense periods of activity and peristalsis. Subsequently, myoelectrical activity is diminished and interdigestive migrating myoelectrical complex (MMC) is replaced by ineffectual and seemingly disorganized clusters of contractions.",

Simple adhesive obstruction is distinguished from other forms of obstruction by the capacity to resolve without surgical intervention. In recent surveys, as many as 80% of episodes of small bowel obstruction due to adhesions may resolve nonoperatively. The likelihood that an obstruction is due to recurrent malignancy relates to several factors including the origin of the primary malignancy, the stage of the primary malignancy, and the designation of original surgery as curative or palliative.

In most cases of simple obstruction, laboratory studies do not play a direct role in diagnosis but are helpful in understanding the extent of complications such as dehydration and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. An elevation of the white blood cell count along with fever, tachycardia, and localized abdominal tenderness is one of the “cardinal signs” for risk for strangulation. However, such an elevation is nonspecific. Similarly, metabolic acidosis may be associated with intestinal ischemia as well as evidence of dehydration and fluid loss. Elevation of BUN and other electrolyte abnormalities also represent fluid loss and dehydration. Therefore, at present there is no non-invasive rapid laboratory tests that can provide information to suggest that tissue necrosis is eminent.",

The potential benefits for a CT scan include not only defining the obstruction and perhaps the nature of the lesion, but also in defining any other evidence of abdominal pathology such as metastases, ascites, or parenchymal liver abnormalities which might be present in a patient with a previous neoplasm. Although none of these tests would be contraindicated, failure of this patient to improve will likely mandate an operation and make contrast studies unnecessary.

Plane radiographs of the abdomen may reveal air in the small bowel and distension of discrete segments of the colon (cecum or transverse colon) or the entire abdominal colon. Distension can become impressive, oftentimes in chronic cases distension in excess of 15 cm can be observed without evidence of colon perforation or wall ischemia. Major risk factors for the development of Ogilvie’s syndrome include severe blunt trauma, orthopedic trauma or procedures, acute cardiac events or coronary bypass surgery, acute neurologic events or neurosurgical procedures, and acute metabolic derangements. Initial management includes resuscitation and correction of the underlying metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities. A nasogastric tube is indicated if the patient is vomiting and will prevent swallowed air from passing distally. If distension is painless and the patient shows no signs of toxicity or bowel ischemia, expectant management can be successful in about 50% of cases. If distension worsens so that the cecal diameter increases beyond 10–12 cm or if it persists for more than 48 hours, colonoscopy is recommended. Endoscopic decompression is successful in 60–90% of cases, but colonic distension may recur in up to 40% of cases. Rectal tubes are ineffective in managing distension of the proximal colon, however, such tubes may be useful after colonoscopy.",

Hernias of all types are second only to adhesions as the most frequent cause of obstruction. External hernias such as inguinal or femoral hernias may present with symptoms of obstruction. Femoral hernias are particularly prone to incarceration and bowel necrosis, due to the small size of the hernia inlet. One important consideration is the Richter’s hernia. In this variant, only a portion of the bowel wall is incarcerated. These most frequently occur in association with femoral or inguinal hernias. Complete obstruction can occur if more than half to two-thirds of the bowel circumference is incarcerated. About 5% of intussusception cases occur as adults. Intussusception occurs when one segment of bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, resulting in obstruction and ischemic injury to the intussuscepting segment. Ninety percent of adult cases are associated with pathological processes. Tumors, benign and malignant, can act as a lead point against the sussesception in over 65% of adult cases.",

From a practical standpoint, ileus represents the interval between abdominal exploration and the reappearance of flatus and bowel movements. Distinguishing a normal postoperative ileus and the prolonged course of a “paralytic” ileus is based primarily on the time since operation and the clinical circumstances. Besides the location of the previous operation (upper abdominal, lower abdominal, pelvic., the nature of the previous operation and the findings may also contribute. Peritonitis or spillage of noxious material leads to an increase in the delay of return of normal bowel function. Distinguishing a paralytic ileus from mechanical obstruction can oftentimes be difficult. Abdominal x-rays in a postoperative ileus should reveal gas in segments of both the small and large bowel. Upper GI contrast or CT scan may also be helpful. Early postoperative obstruction is uncommon and is particularly rare for upper abdominal surgery, with most cases occurring after surgery of the colon, particularly abdominal perineal resection. There has been little success in the use of prokinetic agents to shorten recovery times after lower abdominal procedures. The use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia may delay the recovery of postoperative ileus when compared to the IM route of narcotic administration.",

The optimal fluid for resuscitation in this patient with a distal small bowel obstruction would likely be Ringer’s lactate or normal saline. Since gastric secretion is a small component of the fluid loss, potassium replacement is likely not particularly important. An indwelling urinary catheter should be placed to monitor the urine output to reflect the fluid status. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a central line is likely unnecessary unless concerns are raised about cardiac status. Nasogastric decompression is indicated in all but mild cases. The nasogastric tube serves to prevent distal passage of swallowed air and minimizes discomfort of reflux of intestinal contents and eliminates vomiting. There appears to be no clinical evidence suggesting the need for urgent operation and therefore resuscitation prior to surgery is of optimal importance in this patient. It has been well established that perioperatively-administered antibiotics reduce wound infection and abdominal sepsis rates in patients undergoing operation to relieve intestinal obstruction, simple or strangulated. Once the decision has been made to proceed with surgery, broad spectrum antibiotics, covering gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes should be given. The use of antibiotics in patients who have not been committed to operation has not been evaluated systematically. Giving antibiotics to patients who are being observed can obscure the underlying process and, in the end, delay optimal therapy.",

Endoscopic examination of the colon and rectum is often performed early in the diagnostic workup. In the presence of colorectal involvement, specific endoscopic features encountered which allow differentiation from ulcerative colitis include: aphthous ulcers, linear ulcers, cobblestoning, and asymmetric and discontinuous involvement. The radiologic examination is essential for differential diagnosis in delineating the extent or the severity of the disease primarily involving the small bowel. Barium contrast studies will disclose a number of specific features in patients with Crohn’s disease. A correlation, however, between the extent of the disease seen radiographically and clinical symptoms does not exist. Recurrent disease after surgical resection is often apparent radiologically before the development of clinical signs and symptoms. The most important differential diagnosis is between Crohn’s disease and chronic ulcerative colitis, especially when the information is limited to the colon and rectum.

Microscopic evidence of Crohn’s disease at the resection margins does not compromise safe anastomosis and therefore frozen section examination of resection margins is not necessary. In patients with multiple strictures of the small bowel, resection may involve excessive resection of bowel. Therefore, strictureplasty is an appropriate surgical therapy. Long-term results using this approach indicate that recurrence rates are not substantially increased with strictureplasty, even though inflamed intestinal tissue is left in situ.

Patients with quiescent disease, or patients who have received remission through medical or surgical therapy, however, do not benefit from long-term continued corticosteroids. Sulfasalazine consisting of a sulfonamide linked to an aspirin analogue (5-ASA) is more effective than placebo in the treatment of acute disease. This agent, however, is most effective in patients with predominantly colonic disease and is less effective than corticosteroids in treating patients with small bowel disease. Asymptomatic patients do not appear to benefit from prophylactic treatment. The immunosuppressive agent azathioprine, which acts to inhibit nucleic acid metabolism, has been demonstrated to be highly effective in long-term use. The use of azathioprine has a steroid-sparing effect with reduction of steroid dose or discontinuation of therapy. In chronic treatment, azathioprine is effective in decreasing disease activity, steroid requirements, and complications leading to surgery, therefore, in contrast to corticosteroids and sulfasalazine, azathioprine appears effective in maintaining remission. Side-effects, however, can be significant including bone marrow suppression and acute pancreatitis. Finally, cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant, has undergone extensive review with the conclusion that low-dose oral cyclosporine treatment confers no therapeutic benefit for patients with low or high disease activity and in no reduction in the need for other forms of therapy.",

Given the difference in length between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, the duodenal epithelium shows a substantially greater propensity towards malignant transformation. Even within the duodenum, two-thirds of the carcinomas occur in the periampullary region suggesting that the periampullary mucosa or luminal content (ingested potential carcinogens) interacts with pancreaticobiliary secretions to induce local neoplastic changes. Crohn’s disease primarily is a disease involving the terminal ileum and therefore it is not surprising that most adenocarcinomas developing in association with Crohn’s disease occur also at this site. Small intestinal lymphomas arise from lymphoid tissue within the wall of the bowel. Therefore lymphomas predominate in the ileum, where the greatest concentration of gut lymphoid tissue occurs. Next to the appendix, which harbors 85% of all carcinoid tumors, the small intestine is by far the next most common site of origin. Approximately ninety percent of small intestinal carcinoids are located in the ileum with 40% found within two feet of the ileocecal junction.

This leads to kinking and angulation of intestinal loops and may eventually result in mechanical obstruction.

Tubular adenomas have a very low malignant potential whereas villous adenomas carry a distinct malignant potential similar to that of colonic villous adenomas. These adenomas occur most commonly in the duodenum and especially in the periampullary region. Brunner gland adenomas represent hyperplasia of the exocrine glands within the proximal duodenal mucosa and have little risk of malignant change. The smooth muscle tumor, leiomyoma, are the most common symptomatic benign neoplasms. Most leiomyomas enlarge with an extraluminal orientation and, may reach considerable size. The tumors eventually may outgrow their blood supply leading to central necrosis, ulceration and intraluminal bleeding. Rupture of the tumor may also occur with intraperitoneal bleeding. Differentiation of larger leiomyomas from their malignant counterpart, leiomyosarcoma, may be difficult on pathologic review. Peutz-Jegher Syndrome is an inherited syndrome associated with multiple gastrointestinal polyps throughout the jejunum and ileum.

The disease is usually diagnosed by abnormal episodes of bleeding, which may occur from trauma, menses, etc. The causative event by which sensitized platelet-associated antibodies are developed is probably multiple. The effect of the platelet-associated antibodies, which is usually IgG, is directed against a platelet-associated antigen and, when coating of normal platelets occurs, results in the platelets being sequestered from the system by the reticuloendothelial system with resultant thrombocytopenia.",

The most common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neiseria meningitidis. Other less common encapsulated organisms have also been identified. In addition, organisms without classical polysaccharide cell walls can occasionally produce overwhelming infection in postsplenectomy patients. The mortality from PSS is approximately 50%. Splenic autotransplantation has been proposed as an alternative means of splenic preservation in patients whose spleens are too severely injured for in situ repair.

Furthermore, splenectomy removes a significant source of antiplatelet IgG production.",

Nonspecific immune function is largely characterized by removal of particulate matter by the macrophages. The spleen contains 25% of the fixed tissue macrophage population in the body. The spleen is more efficient than the liver at removal of incompletely opsonized bacteria. The liver is most effective at removing bacteria with a high density of surface opsonins. The spleen also serves as a principal source of nonspecific opsonins. These include tuftsin, properidin, and fibronectin. Tuftsin stimulates granulocyte and macrophage motility and phagocytosis. Properdin activates the alternative pathway of the complement system, leading to complement fixation. Both the activated complement complexes and the complement products facilitate the destruction of the target organism. Fibronectin is a macromolecule that appears to have nonspecific stimulatory activity on the processes of fibrosis and wound healing. The specific immune functions of the spleen are principally related to its antigen-processing role, and this is in turn dependent on its unique anatomy and the circulation of lymphocytes into the spleen. The liver, not the spleen, is the major site of synthesis of complement pathway proteins.",

The cervical esophagus lies just anterior to the prevertebral fascia and courses through the neck posterior to the trachea and to the left of the midline. The cervical esophagus is therefore more readily approached surgically through a left neck incision. The thoracic esophagus enters the posterior mediastinum posterior to the aortic arch. Therefore, when operating on the upper esophagus, a right thoracotomy is preferred, since the aortic arch overlies the esophagus in the left chest. The esophagus descends in the posterior mediastinum behind the left mainstem bronchus and pericardium. It is the proximity of the esophagus and left mainstem bronchus that is responsible for the development of malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas between these two structures. The esophagus enters the diaphragmatic hiatus, which is located at the level of T11. As it enters the abdomen, the esophagus deviates anteriorly and to the left. Therefore, when performing rigid esophagoscopy as the distal esophagus is entered, the patient's head must be turned to the right and the esophagoscope elevated anteriorly to avoid perforation.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Poor technique, not poor blood supply, explains most esophageal anastomotic leaks. While the major blood supply of the esophagus is from four to six segmental aortic esophageal arteries, there are extensive submucosal collaterals from the inferior thyroid, intercostal, bronchial, inferior phrenic, and left gastric arteries. The esophagus lacks serosa and instead is surrounded by mediastinal connective tissue (adventitia). There are two muscle layers in the esophagus, an outer longitudinal and an inner circular one. Both layers of the upper third of the esophagus consist of striated muscle, while in the lower two thirds they are (nonstriated) smooth muscle. The recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerves provide both parasympathetic innervation to the cervical esophagus and innervation to the upper esophageal sphincter (UES). Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve therefore results in improved UES function with secondary aspiration on swallowing as well as vocal cord dysfunction and hoarseness. The esophagus has extensive lymphatic drainage, with lymphatic capillaries coursing longitudinally in the esophageal wall and communicating with paraesophageal, paratracheal and subcarinal, other mediastinal, perigastric, and internal jugular lymph nodes. This accounts for the biologically aggressive nature of esophageal carcinoma, which tends to metastasize early in its course.",

While, in general, no HPZ value absolutely indicates either competence or incompetence of the LES mechanism, patients with a mean HPZ pressure less than 6 mm. Hg or a sphincter length less than 2 cm. are likely to have an incompetent LES and gastroesophageal reflux. Esophageal manometry defines the amplitude and length of the distal HPZ and the character of esophageal peristalsis. It does not determine whether or not the LES is competent. The Bernstein test identifies the patient with an acid-sensitive esophagus but does not indicate whether or not the patient has gastroesophageal reflux or esophagitis. Reflex distal HPZ relaxation occurs within 1.5 to 2.5 seconds after a swallow is initiated and lasts 4 to 6 seconds.

Characteristic consistent abnormalities of UES function in patients with cricopharyngeal dysfunction have not been well documented. UES dysfunction results in cervical dysphagia, expectoration of saliva that is no longer swallowed freely, and, often, intermittent hoarseness due to alteration of the larynx and vocal cords by the pull of the abnormal cricopharyngeal sphincter. Barium esophagography in the patient with UES dysfunction frequently shows a posterior cricopharyngeal “bar,” representing the prominent impression of the sphincter on the esophageal lumen. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux may present with cervical dysphagia due to secondary UES dysfunction. Successful medical or surgical treatment of the reflux may eliminate the cervical complaints. Since the UES is normally 3 to 5 cm. long, when a cervical esophagomyotomy is required for treatment of cricopharyngeal dysfunction, a generous myotomy, 7 to 10 cm. long, is carried out to ensure complete division of all incoordinated UES muscle fibers.",

The classic manometric findings of achalasia are failure of relaxation of the LES on swallowing and absent or weak simultaneous contractions in the esophageal body after swallowing. Achalasia is currently incurable, and, though the recently described endoscopic botulinum toxin injection of the lower esophageal sphincter, pneumatic dilatation, and esophagomyotomy effectively relieve dysphagia in the majority of patients, all of these treatments are strictly palliative.

Psychiatric disorders (depression, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety) have been documented in more than 80% of patients with esophageal contraction abnormalities. The classic manometric criteria of diffuse esophageal spasm are simultaneous, multiphasic, repetitive, high-amplitude contractions occurring after a swallow and spontaneously. These changes may not be detected if manometry is performed when the patient is having no pain. As the cause of esophageal spasm is unknown, treatment is far from ideal. Conservative management—avoidance of “trigger” foods and drinks, psychiatric counseling, treatment of reflux, esophageal dilatations, use of histamine H 2 blockers, anti-spasmodics, and smooth muscle relaxants—should always be attempted first.

Consistent use of standardized grading systems for endoscopic reflux esophagitis (e.g., that of Belsey or Savary) provides a more objective description of the changes seen and allows more meaningful evaluation of patients at different times and by different observers. The size of the lumen does not predict whether or not a reflux stricture is dilatable. Even a tight 2-mm. lumen can be traversed with a guidewire over which Savary dilators can be used to achieve an acceptable lumen size. Every newly diagnosed esophageal stricture warrants esophagoscopy with brushings and biopsies of the stricture (to exclude carcinoma) and an assessment of its “dilatability.” Antireflux medical therapy is not justified until carcinoma has been ruled out. Because the squamocolumnar epithelial junction may normally be found within 2 to 3 cm. of the anatomic esophagogastric junction, the diagnosis of Barrett's mucosa requires identification of the columnar epithelium at least 3 mm. proximal to the junction of the tubular esophagus and the stomach. In advanced achalasia with megaesophagus, the dilated esophagus may have a capacity of 1 to 2 liters, and simply fasting overnight does not ensure that the esophagus is empty of food and drink consumed the day before. Life-threatening massive regurgitation and aspiration may occur as the endoscope is being introduced unless an effort is made to evacuate the esophagus first by means of a nasogastric tube.",

When suspected on the basis of its radiographic appearance, biopsy of the mass should not be performed at the time of esophagoscopy, so that subsequent extramucosal resection will not be complicated by scarring at the biopsy site. The preferred surgical approach is submucosal enucleation of the mass, not full-thickness excision. Leiomyomas have a characteristic hypoechogenic homogeneous appearance on esophageal ultrasonography that allows a noninvasive diagnosis and means of surveillance. Submucosal enucleation of leiomyomas, without wide local excision, provides excellent long-term results with virtually no local recurrence rate.",

In the majority of patients, local tumor invasion or distant metastases preclude cure when esophageal carcinoma is diagnosed, and attempts to improve survival with a more radical local operation performed in the face of systemic disease have been disappointingly futile. A cervical esophagogastric anastomotic leak causes a relatively minor cervical salivary fistula that heals in 7 to 10 days in 95% of patients. In contrast, an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomotic leak results in mediastinitis, which is fatal in 50%. The leading complications of transthoracic esophagectomy and an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis are respiratory insufficiency (from combined thoracic and abdominal incisions) and anastomotic leak resulting in mediastinitis and sepsis. Both complications are minimized by transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy plus cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. No single operative approach to the treatment of esophageal cancer has proved superior to others in terms of long-term survival. The biologic behavior of the tumor (its stage and aggressiveness)—not the number of lymph nodes resected with the tumor—determines survival.",

Although the history may shed light on the possibility of a burn and its severity, all too often the event goes unwitnessed or the type and amount of ingested substance are not known with certainty. The identification of oropharyngeal burns clearly indicates the need for endoscopy, but as many as 70% of patients with such lesions escape associated esophageal injury. Conversely, 10% to 30% of patients with no external evidence of burns have subsequently been confirmed by esophagoscopy to have sustained damage. In the absence of an identifiable perforation, a barium esophagogram can rarely be considered unequivocally diagnostic of acute injury, though such an injury may be suggested when the esophagus appears atonic and dilated, rigid and persistently narrowed, or excessively irritable. Because of the importance of early confirmation of the presence or absence of a significant esophageal burn as a guide to formulating appropriate treatment, esophagoscopy should be performed expeditiously as soon as sufficient time has elapsed to allow gastric emptying and stabilization of the patient, preferably within the first 12 to 48 hours after ingestion.",

Failure of the patient to cooperate effectively condemns to failure any attempt at restoring esophageal patency by bougienage, because sporadic attempts at dilation do not allow progressive lumen enlargement but, rather, invite additional injury because of the necessity for repeated instrumentation of a recurrent, tight stricture. The need for repeated dilation of extensive or multiple strictures over a period exceeding 6 months should prompt surgical reconstruction of the esophagus, especially in young children, for whom the psychological and physical hazards are intensified by prolonged treatment. In such circumstances, a 2-year period of attempted bougienage is excessive. Although iatrogenic perforation often signals the need for esophageal reconstruction, this misadventure should not be considered an absolute indication but should be assessed in relation to (1) the extent and complexity of the stricture, (2) the potential for eventually achieving successful bougienage, and (3) the severity of complications caused by the secondary injury.",

Unlike colonic polyps, gastric epithelial polyps are very uncommon tumors (prevalence 0.4% to 0.8%). Their histologic appearance cannot be predicted on the basis of location in the stomach, although the endoscopic literature is beginning to define predictive algorithms based on location and ultrasound. Multiple polyps are almost always of a single histologic type. Gastric adenomatous polyps have long been associated with adenocarcinoma. This association is directly related to the size of the polyps. Up to 24% of polyps 2 cm. or greater in diameter are associated with adenocarcinoma. In contrast, only 4% of polyps with a diameter less than 2 cm. are associated with carcinoma.

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Approximately 40% of benign tumors of the stomach are leiomyomas derived from the smooth muscle of the stomach or its associated blood vessels. Because it is rare for gastric leiomyomas smaller than 3 cm. in diameter to be symptomatic, considerably fewer than 2% of gastric neoplasms resected surgically are of smooth muscle origin. Gastric leiomyomas may be smooth or lobulated, but in time a central ulceration occurs in the mucosal bulge of the tumor in approximately half of submucosal leiomyomas. Ulceration may be present in smaller tumors but absent in very large tumors. Overlying central mucosal ulceration, which may penetrate deeply into the tumor, results in hematemesis, melena, or anemia and draws attention to the tumor. Bleeding from the tumor may be massive and/or intermittent. Gastric leiomyomas are not encapsulated, even though on section they appear to be well-circumscribed. Microscopically, the tumor cells at the margin may intermingle with cells of the surrounding gastric wall. Along with the presence of occasional large cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, this has led to confusion in distinguishing benign tumors from malignant ones. Stout described a reasonably distinct variety of gastric smooth muscle tumor that he called leiomyoblastoma (bizarre smooth muscle tumor). They were characterized histologically by polyhedral smooth muscle cells with central nuclei and abundant cytoplasm rather than elongated cells. A clear zone that surrounds the central nucleus may be an artifact of fixation. Leiomyoblastoma may be benign or malignant. Carney has described a syndrome characterized by the triad of multiple malignant leiomyoblastoma, pulmonary chondroma, and functioning extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The principle of surgical treatment of smooth muscle tumors is local excision with a 2- to 3-cm. margin of surrounding gastric wall. In view of the difficulty in distinguishing between the benign and malignant variants, enucleation is not an appropriate method of treatment. Regional lymphadenectomy is not of proven value, even if malignancy is strongly suspected and is not consistent with the known property of these tumors to spread by the hematogenous route.",

The duodenum crosses the lumbar spine from right to left and passes upward. It is at this point of passage of the duodenum upward and over the spine that the obstruction occurs. Arteriographic studies show that the aortomesenteric angle in patients with the syndrome is only about 8 degrees. There is no narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery or disturbance of arterial flow, but the area of duodenal obstruction corresponds to the compression of the bowel by the artery.

H. pylori infection is associated with atrophic gastritis, a known precursor to gastric cancer. Important studies of large populations indicate that the majority of patients with gastric cancer are H. pylori positive. The bacteria produce toxins such as ammonia and acetaldehyde, which could lead to chronic inflammation and epithelial damage. Dietary ascorbic acid has been associated with overall improvements in diet and is not associated with the development of gastric cancer.",

The presence of a motility disorder alters the operative strategy. If the peristaltic amplitude is low (20 mm Hg) in the distal third of the esophagus, a Nissen fundoplication would create too much resistance and lead to dysphagia. In this situation the Belsey fundoplication is a better choice. Moreover, it allows the surgeon to mobilize the esophagus to a much greater extent than is possible through the abdomen. In addition to extensive mobilization, a Collis gastroplasty can be created to produce an extra 5 cm of “neo-esophagus” around which a Belsey procedure can be added. End-stage reflux disease, for example, when there is an undilatable stricture or after previous unsuccessful anti-reflux operations or when Barrett’s esophagus leads to high grade dysplagia, is best served by esophageal replacement.

        "explanation": "Esophageal manometry is an investigative tool in which a catheter containing pressure sensors is inserted into the esophagus and used to measure pressures in esophageal body and sphincters at rest and in response to swallowing. It is indicated in a number of clinical situations including nonobstructive dysphasia, noncardiac chest pain, and the assessment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The indications for manometry in patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux are chiefly to assess the status of the LES and to identify a motility disorder of the body. A defective sphincter is predictive of a poor long-term response to medical therapy, but a good response to surgery. The presence of a motility defect profoundly alters the operative strategy in patients with GERD and should always be excluded by manometry prior to operative therapy. In assessment of the LES, three components are measured: the resting pressure, the overall length of the sphincter, and the abdominal length. A defect in the values for each of these components are determined when the lower limits of normal (fifth percentile) are determined. A defect in one or even two components of the LES may be compensated for by good esophageal body function, but when all three components are defective, excessive esophageal acid exposure is inevitable. All the pressures measured along the length of the sphincter and around its circumference during the pull-through may be treated as vectors having both magnitude and direction and hence integrated into a three-dimensional image, the volume (Vector Volume) of which is a measure of LES resistance. A Vector Volume below the fifth percentile of normal is the most sensitive measure of mechanical deficiency of the LES. The prevalence of a defective LES increases with increasing severity of GERD, being the lowest in patients without evidence of endoscopic injury and highest in patients with stricture or Barrett’s esophagus.",

        "explanation": "The x-ray demonstrates moderately advanced achalasia with a dilated esophagus with a narrowed tapering “bird’s beak” appearance of the distal esophagus. Achalasia is the best known primary motility disorder of the esophagus. It is characterized by failure of the esophageal body peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the LES. It is generally thought to be caused by neuronal degeneration of the myenteric plexus of the esophageal wall, causing aperistalsis, and to loss of activity of the inhibitory neurons in the LES leading to incomplete relaxation. Patients with achalasia all have dysphagia, and most have regurgitation. Careful questioning is needed to distinguish the regurgitation from vomiting. Generally, it occurs during or at the end of a meal, and the material tastes bland rather than sour or bitter. Patients often have to leave the table to regurgitate, and are usually slow eaters. Endoscopy frequently reveals residual liquid or food in the esophagus. Unlike a stricture, the narrowing of the lower end permits the passage of the endoscope, usually with a characteristic “popping” sensation. In every patient with presumed achalasia, it is very important to view the cardia from below with the endoscope retroflexed, as a small infiltrating gastroesophageal tumor may otherwise be missed. Manometry is required to establish the diagnosis of achalasia. The classic features on stationary manometry are: 1) Elevated LES pressure; 2) Incomplete LES relaxation; 3) Absence of esophageal body peristalsis; and 4) Positive intraesophageal body pressure. Although reports concerning the use of 24 hr pH monitoring appear in the literature, excessive acid exposure is rare.",

It is now the principal method to make the diagnosis of GERD and has effectively replaced all other methods of measuring esophageal acid exposure. It is indicated in any patient with symptoms suggesting GERD, unless the symptoms are trivial, or permanently abolished by a short course of acid suppression therapy. Reflux episodes are defined as periods when the esophageal pH is less than pH 4. Normal (physiologic) reflux occurs in the form of short rapidly cleared postprandial episodes. A few episodes of long duration are more injurious than many brief episodes, even though total acid exposure time may be similar. In addition to the measurement of acid exposure, pH monitoring can also be used to detect excessive alkaline exposure (pH > 7) in the esophagus. The Bernstein test, in which hydrochloric acid is dripped into the esophagus via a nasogastric tube, is sometimes used to determine if a patient’s symptoms are reproduced by acidic exposure. It is basically a measure of esophageal mucosal sensitivity. It has been largely superseded by the use of 24 hr pH monitoring. Gastric emptying is affected by the composition and consistency of the ingested meal. Delayed gastric emptying may be an important etiologic factor in patients with GERD and a normal LES.",

        ],
        "explanation": "When patients are correctly selected and the operation performed with conformity with the basic surgical principles, long-term relief of symptoms is achieved by more than 90% of patients. A number of patterns of failure, however, can occur. The so-called Slipped Nissen may develop when the upper stomach rides up through the fundoplication, and causes both dysphagia and heartburn. It is more likely that the condition was created at the time of surgery because the surgeon did not mobilize the fundus, or because unrecognized esophageal shortening led to inadequate mobilization of the gastroesophageal junction, causing the surgeon to wrap the stomach around the upper stomach rather than the lower esophagus. Creating too tight a fundoplication leads to immediate postoperative dysphagia. Manometry shows a high pressure nonrelaxing sphincter which may be difficult to distinguish from achalasia. Such patients highlight the importance of manometry in all patients before proceeding with anti-reflux surgery. In a patient with normal preoperative motility, the cause is usually a fault in technique, and can be prevented by constructing the fundoplication over a 60 F Bougie. Disruption of the fundoplication that manifests clinically and physiologically by recurrent reflux can be caused by inadequate suture technique, unrecognized esophageal shortening leading to tension on the wrap, or poor choice of operation. All partial fundoplications, such as the Toupet procedure are more prone to disruption than a Nissen. This is because the integrity of the repair depends on sutures to the esophageal wall and not the stomach, and because all these repairs require much more abdominal length of esophagus than a Nissen, thus placing the repair under tension. Esophagectomy and esophageal replacement are occasionally indicated in the treatment of advanced GERD. The indications for esophagectomy are Barrett’s esophagus with high grade dysplasia and what is generally described “burned out esophagus” which includes failure of a third anti-reflux operation, a severe coexistent motility disorder, or the presence of an undilatable stricture. Either colon or stomach may be used to replace the esophagus. Colonic replacement is more difficult, requiring three anastomoses rather than one, but it has superior functional long-term results.",

        "explanation": "Endoscopy is generally the first investigation in patients with foregut symptoms. The exception is when the patient’s chief complaint is dysphagia, when a “road map” should first be obtained by a barium swallow. The locations of the esophageal landmarks are measured endoscopically from the incisor teeth. Three landmarks are measured in the region of the cardia: the level of the crura, the level of the anatomic gastroesophageal junction, and the level of the squamo-columnar junction (Z line). A hiatal hernia is present when the gastroesophageal junction is more than 2 cm above the crura. Barrett’s esophagus is suggested when the squamo-columnar junction is more than 2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction but may be diagnosed if any specialized epithelium is identified above the gastroesophageal junction histologically, regardless of measured length of the columnar segment. Three areas of esophageal narrowing are frequently noted on both barium esophogram and endoscopy. The first narrowing is at the site of the cricopharyngeus muscle. The left mainstem bronchus and aortic arch caused narrowing of the middle third of the esophagus. The most distal narrowing of the esophagus is at the diaphragmatic hiatus and is caused by the lower esophageal sphincter mechanism. These normal points of narrowing tend to retard swallowed foreign objects. Also, corrosive liquid ingestion results in prominent mucosal injury at these sites as the liquid is slowed at passage. CT scan of the esophagus is important in delineating the relationship of esophageal lesions to adjacent structures, especially the trachea, left main bronchus and aorta. The esophagus normally appears as a flattened hollow structure with a thin wall. A more circular cross-sectional appearance with a fluid level is evidence of distal obstruction.",

Secondly, the patient must have either symptoms or complications of the disease. Thirdly, the disease should be caused by defect appropriate to surgical therapy, i.e., a mechanically defective sphincter. Some patients with increased acid exposure and a mechanically defective sphincter, and who have no complications of the disease respond well to medical therapy, but they require long-term medication for continued relief. These patients should be given the option of surgery as a cost effective alternative. Atypical symptoms of reflux such as respiratory manifestations often respond well to anti-reflux surgery. When respiratory symptoms are combined with typical symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, the results of anti-reflux surgery are generally good. Complaints of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite may be due to excessive duodenogastric reflux which occurs in about 11% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. This problem is usually, but not invariably, confined to patients who have previous upper gastrointestinal surgery. The coexistence of these gastric symptoms in a patient who also has typical symptoms of GERD should prompt a thorough evaluation of the stomach using a bile probe, 24 hour pH monitoring or radionucleotide scanning. In such patients, the correction of only the incompetent cardia can result in a disgruntled individual who continues to complain of nausea and epigastric pain on eating.",

        "explanation": "Disorders of the pharyngoesophageal phase of swallowing result from a discoordination of the neuromuscular events involved in chewing, initiation of swallowing, and propulsion of the material from the oropharynx to the cervical esophagus. The commonest causes of pharyngoesophageal dysphagia are neuromuscular diseases. The most important are cerebrovascular disease, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular diseases such as myotonic dystrophy and polymyositis. In neuromuscular diseases, dysphagia is often worse for liquids than for solids. Choking, repetitive pneumonia, nasal regurgitation and hoarseness are also prominent features. The surgeon’s role in the treatment of cricopharyngeal disorders is to reduce outflow resistance by performing a cricomyotomy. Initially this was recommended only for patients with demonstrable failure of the upper esophageal sphincter relaxation. More recently, a number of reports indicate a wide variety of neuromuscular diseases that may be improved by cricomyotomy. The surgical options in Zenker’s diverticulum are either excision or suspension. Excision is sometimes recommended on the grounds that malignant change in the sac is prevented, but there is no evidence that excision carries any greater protective role than suspension, which effectively prevents stagnation of food material, thus removing the presumed cause of malignant change. Suspension also removes the risk of contamination of the operative site, the risk of subsequent breakdown of the closure site with fistula formation, and the risk of narrowing of the esophagus. In either case, recurrence is likely if cricomyotomy is not performed, because the underlying defect which predisposes to the diverticulum persists. All operations on the cervical esophagus carry the risk of hematoma formation and recurrent nerve paralysis. The venous pumping action of the lung can cause the development of a large hematoma in the mediastinum postoperatively, therefore meticulous hemostasis is critical for the performance of this operation.",

        "explanation": "Barrett’s esophagus is now recognized as a complication of advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease. The histologic hallmark of Barrett’s esophagus is the presence of “specialized” columnar epithelium, which shows features of intestinal metaplasia, easily recognized by the presence of goblet cells. The presence of specialized epithelium is now regarded as the pathonomonic feature of Barrett’s esophagus regardless of how high it extends into the esophagus. Barrett’s esophagus may exist on its own, or may be itself associated with ulceration, stricture, and malignant change. Once Barrett’s epithelium is present, medical therapy or anti-reflux surgery rarely causes it to regress. Unless it is actually ablated, for example with laser therapy, it persists. The most significant feature of Barrett’s esophagus is its malignant potential. The metaplastic epithelium usually undergoes dysplastic change prior to becoming frankly neoplastic. High grade dysplagia is synonymous with carcinoma in situ, and if the esophagus is removed for such a condition, up to 50% will demonstrate foci of invasive carcinoma. In the past, the pathophysiology of Barrett’s esophagus was associated with alkaline reflux on esophageal pH monitoring. However, more recently using a bile sensor for monitoring bilirubin, this condition is frequently associated with excessive bile in the esophagus. Repetitive injury from noxious gastric juice can lead during the repair process to mutations in the p53 gene. Patients with adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett’s esophagus have a high incidence of p53 mutations.",

        "correct": [
          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "The blood supply and venous drainage of the esophagus are largely segmental. The inferior thyroid artery provides the main blood supply to the cervical portion of the esophagus. The thoracic portion of the esophagus receives its blood supply from two sources; branches from two or three bronchial arteries provide the proximal arterial supply and branches directly from the aorta supply the more distal thoracic esophagus. Intrathoracic mobilization of the esophagus during performance of anti-reflux procedures often require ligation of these branches. The venous plexus in the submucosa collects capillary blood and delivers it into a periesophageal venous plexus. The left gastric vein or coronary vein provides the principal collateral in portal hypertension when esophageal varices develop. The submucosal veins become much more superficial in the most distal esophagus, 1–2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction, and are consequently the most common site of bleeding in portal hypertension. The lymphatics of the esophagus form a rich submucosal network draining into regional lymph nodes in the periesophageal connective tissue. There is thus little barrier to longitudinal spread of cancer in the esophagus. Lymphatic drainage from the upper two-thirds of the esophagus is usually cephalad, but drainage from the lower one-third is in both directions. Although lymphatic metastasis in the esophagus generally involve the regional lymph nodes in proximity, nodal involvement may occur several centimeters away from the primary lesion because of the rich intramural lymphatic anastomotic channels. When a carcinoma is limited to the mucosa, the incidence of lymphatic metastases is low, but once into the submucosa, the incidence rises to 60%.",

        "explanation": "The cricopharyngeus muscle is a continuation of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx and receives its innervation via both the right and left recurrent laryngeal nerves. Although much attention is given to vocal cord dysfunction that accompanies recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, it is clear that cricopharyngeal sphincter dysfunction and motility problems of the cervical esophagus can occur with injury to these nerves. Serious aspiration following recurrent nerve injury is caused not only by the cricopharyngeal dysfunction, but also by additional morbidity incurred because of the inability to close the glottis during swallowing and loss of the protection afforded by effective coughing. Clinically, peristaltic defects of the esophageal body fall into one of to broad categories. One category is characterized by a defect in organization of peristaltic waves, and is primarily a neural phenomenon. The other notable defect is reduction of the power (amplitude) of peristalsis and is usually due to muscle damage secondary to severe reflux or replacement with fibrous tissue as happens in scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases or with severe reflux. The LES provides a pressure barrier between the esophagus and stomach. The sphincter normally remains actively closed to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Relaxation of the LES is mediated by inhibitory neurons. It occurs either to allow entry of food, or to allow exit of air during belching. The ability of the LES to remain closed in the face of a pressure gradient tending to promote reflux of gastric contents from the positive pressure environment of the stomach into the negative pressure environment of the chest depends on several features. The most significant is the resting pressure. However, of equal importance is the ability of the LES to respond to variations in intra-abdominal pressure associated with daily activities. Such elevations would normally be transmitted to the sphincter, causing it to collapse and remain closed, provided sufficient length of the sphincter remains exposed to the abdominal pressure and the compressive effect of the crura. The abdominal length is often reduced in hiatal herniation, because of attenuation of the pharyngoesophageal membrane. The overall length of the LES is also an important determinant of competence, much as the total resistance of a series of resisters in a circuit is the sum of the individual resistances. A mechanically-defective sphincter, however, is not always associated with increased esophageal acid exposure because it may be compensated by the clearance function of the esophageal body. The role of the esophageal body in limiting acid reflux is related to its ability to clear the esophagus of acid. This clearance has two components: volume clearance which requires peristalsis, and chemical clearance which requires saliva.",

        "explanation": "The mainstay of treatment in achalasia is either balloon dilatation or surgery. Balloon dilatation has an advantage that it can be performed as an outpatient and has minimal recovery time. It is less likely to be effective than surgical treatment, and frequently needs to be repeated. The risk of perforation of the lower esophagus is higher with this procedure than with any other form of esophageal instrumentation and varies from 2–10%. The risk of gastroesophageal reflux following dilatation is not known, but symptomatically the risk appears to be low. All surgical procedures employ a variant of Heller’s myotomy, in which the circular muscle of the lower esophagus is divided. In the United States, most myotomies are carried out through the chest, but the abdominal approach is favored in Europe. Regardless of the route chosen, four key principles are important, namely: 1) adequate myotomy, 2) minimal hiatal disturbance, 3) anti-reflux protection without creation of obstruction, and 4) prevention of rehealing. The advent of minimally invasive surgery has led to the development of thorascopic and laparoscopic myotomy, and these are now being extensively performed with comparable results to open surgery. There is broad agreement that if a myotomy is performed through the abdomen, an anti-reflux procedure should be added, and that a full Nissen wrap, however floppy, leads to long-term failure. When approached through the chest, there is controversy about the need for an anti-reflux procedure, as it is claimed that less hiatal disturbance and more limited myotomy is possible by this route. Thoracoscopic myotomy, with enhanced view, enables a more precise determination of the distal myotomy and therefore may not require a anti-reflux procedure. A single pneumatic dilatation achieves adequate relief of dysphasia and pharyngeal regurgitation in about 60% of patients. Repetitive dilatations increase this figure to about 70%. Only one controlled randomized study comparing the two modes of therapy has ever been performed. The results of this study as well as a number of retrospective studies would appear to support operative myotomy as the initial treatment of choice.",

The cervical esophagus is about 5 cm long. It begins at the level of C6 and extends to the lower border of T1, curving slightly to the left in its descent. Consequently, although the surgical approach to this portion of the esophagus may be from either side of the neck through an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the left side is chosen if possible. Above the level of the tracheal bifurcation, the esophagus moves to the right of the descending aorta. It then moves to the left, passes behind the tracheal bifurcation and the left main bronchus and descends to the diaphragm. In the lower third, the esophagus courses anteriorly and to the left to pass through the diaphragmatic hiatus. The lower esophagus is covered only by a flimsy mediastinal pleura on the left, and it is this portion which is most commonly the site of spontaneous perforation in Boerhaave’s syndrome. In general, the lower esophagus is most easily approached through the left chest, but access to the supra-aortic esophagus is restricted. Thus, a left thoracotomy is most useful for performing procedures involving the lower esophagus. However, access to the entire thoracic esophagus can be obtained only from the right chest. This incision, however, limits access to intraabdominal organs by the position of the liver and therefore normally requires a separate upper abdominal incision. The abdominal esophagus begins as the esophagus enters the abdomen through the diaphragmatic hiatus. It is surrounded by a fibroelastic membrane, the phrenoesophageal ligament which arises from the subdiaphragmatic fascia. The lower limit of the pharyngoesophageal membrane anteriorly is marked by a prominent fat pad, which corresponds to the gastroesophageal junction. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a zone of high pressure 3–5 cm long at the lower end of the esophagus. Although it does not correspond to any macroscopic anatomical structure, its function appears to be related to the microscopic architecture of the muscle fibers.",

        "explanation": "The barium esophogram of these two patients shows diffuse esophageal spasm resulting in a cork screw esophagus with multiple contractions. See Fig. 18-35. These primary motor disorders are characterized by substernal chest pain. In the nutcracker variety, as demonstrated in this x-ray, the pain is central crushing pain with no relation to food ingestion and differs from angina in that it more frequently comes on at rest. Dysphagia or classic heartburn may be present but tend to be overshadowed by the chest pain. Barium radiography and endoscopy are generally not helpful. The pathognomic feature of manometry is the presence of prolonged high amplitude waves, with a peak greater than 180 mm Hg. Diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus are benign conditions which rarely cause nutritional problems and do not lead to life-threatening complications. For this reason, symptom control is the only significant goal of treatment. Medical treatment for diffuse esophageal spasm and nutcracker esophagus is focused on abolishing strong simultaneous contractions and generally employs calcium channel blocking agents or long-acting nitrates. Surgery for these conditions are generally only considered when medical treatment is ineffective.",

        "explanation": "Ninety percent of acquired fistulas between the esophagus and tracheobronchial tree in adults are the result of malignant disease. Tracheoesophageal fistulas complicate the course of disease in about 5% of patients who have esophageal carcinoma. Nearly 80% of patients with malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas die within three months of the onset of symptoms and in 85% of these patients, the cause of death is aspiration pneumonia, not distant metastatic disease. For the most part, malignant tracheoesophageal fistula represents incurable disease for which resection carries significant mortality and is seldom indicated. Palliative relief of recurrent aspiration is the aim of therapy. Effective occlusion of the fistula may be achieved by insertion of one of a variety of available endoesophageal endoprostheses. These tubes are placed into the esophagus with the aid of an esophagoscope and may occlude the esophageal side of the fistula sufficiently to allow swallowing of liquids without aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree. More recently, expandable metal stents have been used successfully in the treatment of malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas. Nonmalignant fistulas result from the erosion by contiguous infected subcarinal mediastinal lymph nodes; trauma; late sequelae of chronic mid-esophageal traction diverticulum; or erosion by an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube cuff in a patient requiring prolonged ventilatory support. Small fistulas, such as resulting from an endotracheal intubation injury, are approached through a cervical collar or oblique incision anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Although such cuff injuries usually produce circumferential tracheal damage which necessitates a tracheal resection, this can also be performed through a cervical collar incision.",

The esophageal duplication cyst is a variation of the foregut cyst, extends along the length of the thoracic esophagus, and is lined by squamous epithelium. More than 60% of esophageal cysts cause either respiratory or esophageal symptoms in the first year of life. Those located in the upper third of the esophagus tend to present in infancy, while the lower-third cyst may be asymptomatic initially and present later in childhood. Adults present with dysphasia, choking, retrosternal pain when previously asymptomatic cysts enlarge as the result of bleeding or infection. The diagnosis of an esophageal cyst can usually be made on the basis of atypical radiographic appearance. The PA and lateral chest x-ray, barium esophogram, and in some cases a CT scan, will confirm the diagnosis in almost all patients. Because esophageal cysts have a predilection for bleeding, ulceration, perforation, and infection, excision is generally recommended.

Candida albicans is a fungus that normally is a commensal inhabitant of the mouth, oral pharynx, and GI tract. This fungus may become pathogenic in patients who are severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. In recent years, the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppression in organ transplant patients, and the wide use of chemotherapeutic agents have resulted in an increased number of patients with monilial esophagitis. As the disease progresses, transmural invasion of the esophageal wall occurs. Although the esophagitis can be controlled with antifungal therapy, if the patient survives the underlying illness, chronic stricture formation may result after healing. Minimally compromised patients with mild monilial esophagitis should receive oral nystatin suspension as a primary treatment. More immunosuppressed patients or those with severe cases warrant high doses of fluconazole and ketoconazole. Intravenous fluconazole or amphotericin B are utilized in granulocytopenic patients. Viral esophagitis is the second most common cause of infectious esophagitis. Herpes simplex viral infection is the most common infection in the immunosuppressed transplant patient. Characteristically, viral esophagitis produces mucosal ulceration with patients presenting with dysphasia and odynophagia. The esophageal ulcers are characteristically small (< 1.5 cm). The diagnosis is established endoscopically by biopsy, brushings, and washings for cytology, histology, and viral culture. The infection usually responds well to treatment with acyclovir.",

Using the arbitrary division of the esophagus, 8% of squamous cell carcinomas occur in the cervical esophagus, 55% in the upper and mid-thoracic segments, and 37% in the lower thoracic segment which extends to the GE junction. Macroscopically, 60% of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus are fungating intraluminal growths, 25% of ulcerative lesions are associated with extensive infiltration of the adjacent esophageal wall, and 15% are infiltrating. Esophageal carcinoma tends to be multi-focal, and a patient who survives treatment of one carcinoma has at least twice the risk of developing a second primary esophageal neoplasm than the normal population. Esophageal carcinoma is notorious for its aggressive biologic behavior. Mediastinal, supraclavicular, or celiac lymph node metastases are present in at least 75% of patients with esophageal cancer at the time of initial diagnosis.

        "explanation": "It is axiomatic that pain or fever after esophageal instrumentation or operation is indicative of an esophageal perforation until proven otherwise. It is an indication for immediate contrast esophogram. Because the morbidity and mortality rates associated with esophageal perforation are directly related to the time interval between diagnosis of the injury and its repair or drainage, an aggressive attitude toward diagnosing the perforation must be adopted. When the diagnosis is considered, a water-soluble contrast agent should be administered. If this study is negative, dilute barium should be administered. Barium is relatively inert, and the fear of barium extravasating in the mediastinum through the site of injury and producing a severe reactive mediastinitis is unfounded. A chest x-ray may help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating air in the soft tissues of the neck or mediastinum or a hyrdo-or pneumothorax. A normal chest x-ray, however, does not rule out an esophageal perforation. Although most esophageal perforations require operative intervention, selected patients may be managed nonoperatively with cessation of oral intake, administration of antibiotics, and intravenous hydration until the disruption heals or the small contained cavity begins to decrease in size. The usual clinical settings for such perforations that are encountered are cervical esophageal tears caused by esophagoscopy; intramural dissection that has occurred during dilatation of a stricture or pneumatic dilatation for achalasia, and an asymptomatic esophageal anastomotic disruption discovered on a routine postoperative contrast study. Perforations complicating pneumatic dilatation for achalasia occur in 4% to 6% of patients, and most are small and well managed medically with antibiotics and intravenous hyperalimentation. If operation is required for suture repair of the perforation, an esophagomyotomy to relieve the distal obstruction, and a partial fundoplication to buttress the tear should be performed if possible.",

Nevertheless, the barium swallow examination localizes obvious esophageal pathology in preparation for subsequent esophagoscopy and allows the endoscopist to predict the level at which the tumor is located and the area which requires the most careful examination. The chest and upper abdominal CT scan is now the standard radiographic technique for staging esophageal carcinoma. Esophageal wall thickness, regional adenopathy or pulmonary, liver, adrenal or distant nodal metastasis can be identified. Although CT is suggested to have a role in evaluating resectability of esophageal carcinoma, it is particularly limited in its ability to detect invasion of the gastric cardia or aortic invasion. Bone scan is not warranted unless the patient has specific complaints suggesting that bone metastases exists. Similarly, routine brain scans are not indicated as brain metastases from carcinoma of the esophagus are uncommon. Bronchoscopy should be performed in patients with carcinoma of the upper and middle thirds of the esophagus to exclude invasion of the posterior membranous trachea or mainstem bronchi, which precludes a safe esophagectomy. Endoscopic ultrasound is being used with increasing frequency as an adjunct to the standard radiologic and endoscopic assessment of esophageal disease. It offers the potential for more sensitive staging of esophageal carcinoma by detecting the depth of invasion and the presence of abnormal mediastinal adenopathy.",

A variety of other esophageal lesions have a recognized premalignant nature.

Ten to 12% of patients with achalasia of the esophagus who are observed 15 years or more develop esophageal carcinoma. This is thought to be related to the irritating effects of the fermenting intraesophageal contents on the adjacent esophageal mucosa. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a premalignant esophageal condition. Patients with this syndrome are typically elderly women who have cervical dysphasia and iron deficiency anemia. About 10% of patients will develop squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oral cavity or esophagus. Finally, there have been isolated reports of esophageal carcinomas found incidentally within esophageal diverticula, presumably as the result of the irritating effects on the mucosa of stagnant, putrefying food within the pouch.

        ],
        "explanation": "For most patients with localized esophageal carcinoma, resection provides the most effective and reliable palliation of dysphagia. The rational surgical approach to distal esophageal carcinoma has been a left thoracoabdominal incision. Tumors involving the mid-esophagus have been resected either through a thoracoabdominal or separate thoracic and abdominal incision, and a high thoracic esophagogastric anastomosis is performed. The major disadvantages of this technique are the necessity of a thoracotomy in debilitated patients with esophageal obstruction as well as the disastrous complications following intrathoracic esophageal anastomotic leak. Although recent results have shown improved operative mortality rates, the operation can still be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A further disadvantage of the standard intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis is inadequate long-term relief of dysphagia either due to tumor recurrence at the anastomotic suture line or due to the development of reflux esophagitis above the anastomosis. Although it has been long taught that the patient with esophageal carcinoma does not live long enough to develop reflux esophagitis after a low intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis, this is clearly not the case, and the development of reflux in these patients can produce not only severe pyrosis and reflux symptoms, but also dysphagia from benign stenosis. During the last two decades, the technique of transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy has been popularized as an operation that minimizes the factors responsible for poor results from traditional transthoracic esophageal resection and reconstruction. In experienced hands, transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy is possible in over 90% of patients. The survival data is comparable to those obtained in most series of transthoracic resection with results usually demonstrating decreased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Although conceptually radical transthoracic esophagectomy with en bloc dissection of contiguous lymph node bearing tissues would appear to offer a better “cancer operation” than transhiatal esophagectomy with no formal lymph node dissection, current survival results are not statistically different. These data suggest that survival after resection for esophageal carcinoma is more a function of the extent and stage of the tumor rather than the size of the specimen or the number of lymph nodes removed.",

Most esophageal diverticula are acquired, and occur predominantly in adults. The pharyngoesophageal (Zenker’s diverticulum) is the most common esophageal diverticulum and typically occurs in patients between 30 and 50 years of age. Mediastinal granulomatous disease (e.g., tuberculosis or histoplasmosis) is the most common cause of mid-esophageal traction diverticulum. This type of diverticulum is much smaller than the pulsion diverticulum and has a characteristic blunt tapered tip that points toward the adjacent subcarinal or peribronchial lymph nodes to which it adheres. It is typically diagnosed as an incidental finding on a barium esophogram and is almost always asymptomatic. No specific treatment is indicated. An epiphrenic or supradiaphragmatic diverticulum occurs within the distal 10 cm of the thoracic esophagus as a pulsion diverticulum that arises because of abnormally elevated intraluminal esophageal pressure. Although many patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis on barium esophogram, others have symptoms from the frequently associated esophageal conditions: hiatal hernia, diffuse esophageal spasm, achalasia, reflux esophagitis and carcinoma. Pouches smaller than 3 cm and causing little or no symptoms require no treatment. Severe dysphagia, chest pain, or an anatomically dependent or enlarging pouch are indications for repair. The surgical approach to an epiphrenic diverticula is through a left 6th or 7th interspace posterolateral thoracotomy.

        "explanation": "Caustic injury occurs in two broad categories of patients, children younger than 5 years of age who accidentally swallow these agents, and adults who are attempting suicide. The most common agents responsible for caustic esophageal injuries are alkalis, acids, bleach and detergents. Ingestion of detergents and bleaches virtually always cause only mild esophageal irritation which heals without significant adverse sequelae. Acids and alkalis may have devastating effects which range from acute multi-organ necrosis and perforation to chronic esophageal and gastric strictures. Alkalis are more destructive, producing liquefaction and necrosis which almost insures deep penetration whereas acids usually cause coagulation necrosis that, in part, limits the depth of injury. Liquid alkali preparations have prolonged contact with the mucosa of the esophagus and stomach due to its high viscosity. In addition, ingested acids typically pass through the esophagus quickly, producing major gastric injury with relative sparing of the esophagus. In response to either ingested acid or alkali, reflex pyloric spasm occurs, with resultant pooling of these agents in the gastric antrum. The clinical manifestations of caustic ingestion are directly related to the amount and character of the agent ingested. When esophageal or gastric perforation results from caustic ingestion, patients demonstrate progressive severe sepsis and hypovolemic shock until appropriate resuscitative measures are instituted. In the absence of gastric or esophageal perforation, the acute clinical manifestations typically resolve within days, with clinical improvement lasting for weeks. After this, symptoms due to either esophageal or gastric stricture begin to form. Most adults who ingest liquid alkali will develop severe esophageal and usually gastric injury that results in stricture formation. Children, with usually more limited exposure from accidental ingestions, are less likely to have severe injuries.",

        "explanation": "Therapy of esophageal carcinoma is influenced by the knowledge that in most of these patients, local tumor invasion or distant metastatic disease preclude cure. While squamous cell carcinoma is generally regarded as a radiosensitive and therefore potentially curable tumor, radiation therapy has not achieved cure in most patients. Although “curative” super voltage radiation techniques have been employed, the average five-year survival after such treatment is between 6 and 10% in most series. This is somewhat poorer than five-year survival rates after resection which usually range between 10 and 15%. A variety of endoesophageal tubes have been used for palliation in patients with esophageal carcinoma. Basically, these tubes are divided into two types: the pulsion tubes, which are pushed through the tumor with the aid of an esophagoscope; and the traction or pull-through tubes, which are pulled into place by downward traction through a gastrostomy. As in the case with many conceptually simple procedures, implementation in the clinical setting is problematic. Transoral esophageal intubation is associated with an overall mortality of 14% and a complication rate of 25%, the latter due to perforation of the esophagus, migration of the tubes, or obstruction of the tubes by food or tumor overgrowth. More recently, a variety of expandable intraesophageal metallic stents have been used to achieve palliation in patients with unresectable esophageal carcinoma. Additional expertise with this technique is being acquired through a multi-institutional trial currently underway in the United States. Endoscopic laser fulguration of esophageal carcinoma has been used to achieve temporary relief of the esophageal obstruction in patients with unresectable tumors. Generally, multiple sessions are required to resect sufficient tumor to achieve adequate lumen, but functional success with restoration of a comfortable volume can be achieved in 75–80%. Although a variety of surgical procedures such as substernal gastric or colon bypasses have been developed as palliative internal bypasses of unresectable esophageal carcinoma, the limited survival in these unresectable patients can be high and the mortality rates, between 15 and 25%, do not currently justify their use.",

        ],
        "explanation": "Leiomyomas represent the most common benign intramural esophageal tumor and characteristically occur in patients between 20 and 50 years of age. More than 80% of esophageal leiomyomas occur in the middle and lower thirds of the esophagus. Tumors less than 5 cm in size rarely cause symptoms. When larger than this, dysphagia, retrosternal pressure and pain are the common complaints. Bleeding more often occurs with the malignant form of the tumor, leiomyosarcoma. Malignant degeneration of leiomyomas is exceedingly rare. An asymptomatic leiomyoma or one discovered incidentally on a barium swallow examination can be safely observed and followed with periodic barium esophograms and endoscopic ultrasonography. Although excision of the esophageal mass provides the only definitive tissue diagnosis, the characteristic radiographic appearance, slow growth rate, and low risk of malignant degeneration and the ability to follow leiomyomas with endoscopic ultrasonography justify conservative management. Tumors that are symptomatic or larger than 5 cm in diameter should be excised. Tumors of the middle third of the esophagus are approached through a right thoracotomy, while those in the distal third are approached through a left thoracotomy. Once the esophagus is encircled and the tumor located, the overlying longitudinal muscle is split in the direction of its fibers. The tumor is then gently dissected away from the contiguous underlying submucosa and adjacent muscle. When enucleation of the tumor is complete, the longitudinal esophageal muscle is reapproximated, although a large extramucosal defect may be left without complication. Giant leiomyomas of the cardia and adjacent stomach may require esophageal resection for their removal. When resection is complete, leiomyomas virtually never recur. Benign polyps of the esophagus are rare and typically arise in the cervical esophagus. Most are seen in older men and are frequently attached to the cricoid cartilage. Histologically, they are composed of fibrovascular tissue with varying amounts of associated fat.",

In one study, 24% of patients had no residual carcinoma in the resected specimen (T0, N0 status).

        "explanation": "Acute caustic ingestion is indication for hospitalization. Initial management centers on stabilizing the patient and assessing the severity of injury. Oral intake should be withheld and hypovolemia corrected with intravenous fluids. Careful observation for evidence of airway obstruction is mandatory. Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated once the diagnosis of substantial esophageal injury has been established to diminish the risk of pulmonary infection from aspiration as well as bacterial invasion through the damaged esophageal wall. Although corticosteroids have been advocated in the acute phase of caustic ingestion to minimize subsequent stricture formation, their efficacy has not been established. Furthermore, because steroids may mask signs of sepsis, visceral perforation, and impair healing, their use in caustic esophageal injury is potentially deleterious and therefore is not recommended. A contrast esophogram is the best way to make the diagnosis of esophageal perforation and should be performed if the diagnosis is suspected at the time of admission or in subsequent followup. Esophagoscopy should be performed soon after admission to establish whether significant esophageal injury has occurred and to permit grading of the severity of injury. Although in the past it was taught that the endoscope should not be advanced beyond the first burned area, more recently complete examination of the esophagus and stomach has been recommended, especially if severe burns are not detected proximally. The use of a pediatric endoscope and adequate sedation can allow this procedure to be accomplished safely. Patients with caustic liquid ingestion that necessitate operative intervention are generally best explored through the abdomen. This approach permits assessment of the injury to the intraabdominal organs as well as resection of areas of full thickness gastric necrosis. Although only the lower esophagus is well visualized through the diaphragmatic hiatus, if an esophageal resection is required, transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy is readily performed by the addition of a cervical incision. When esophageal gastric resection for acute caustic injury is required, restoration of alimentary continuity should be deferred until the patient has recovered from the acute insult and the development of chronic stricture formation and retained organs can be evaluated. Esophageal stricture formation following second and third degree burns is the rule, and dilatation therapy has been the traditional therapy for chronic caustic esophageal strictures. It is important that dilatation not be instituted until at least six to eight weeks after the injury, when reepithelialization is complete, in order to minimize the risk of perforation.",

The right gastroepiploic artery, derived from the gastroduodenal artery, and the left gastroepiploic artery, from the splenic artery, traverse the greater curvature. The area adjacent to the spleen receives multiple short gastric arterial branches.

        "explanation": "The three major stimulants of acid secretion by the parietal cell are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine. Acetylcholine is released from cholinergic nerve endings in close proximity to parietal cells and binds to muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic stimulation of parietal cells is coupled to hydrolysis of membrane-associated lipids (termed phosphatidylinositides) and leads to increases in intracellular calcium. Histamine is released from mast cells in the lamina propria and reaches parietal cells by diffusion. Histamine occupies H2 receptors that may be selectively blocked by agents such as cimetidine. Histamine stimulation of parietal cell acid secretion is mediated by a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Gastrin is delivered to the fundic mucosa by the systemic circulation from its source in the antrum and duodenum. Like acetylcholine, gastrin causes increases in membrane phosphoinositol turnover and increases intracellular calcium. Activation of parietal cells by acetylcholine, gastrin or histamine can be blocked by somatostatin. Local release of somatostatin is physiologically important in modulating postprandial gastric acid secretion. Prostaglandin E2 and its synthetic derivatives are potent inhibitors of histamine-stimulated acid secretion.",

In addition to well-recognized stimulatory actions on gastric acid secretion, gastrin promotes mucosal growth of the gastric fundus and small intestine. The most important stimulant of gastrin release is a meal. Small peptide fragments and amino acids that result from intragastric proteolysis are the food components that stimulate gastrin release. Ingested fats and carbohydrates have no significant effect. In this regard, intraluminal pH strongly affects gastrin secretion. If intragastric pH is maintained above 3 after ingestion of a meal, gastrin release is strongly potentiated. Pernicious anemia and atrophic gastritis, which produce chronic achlorhydria, are associated with fasting hypergastrinemia and an exaggerated gastrin meal response. Conversely, antral acidification strongly inhibits gastrin secretion. Locally-released somatostatin mediates the effects of luminal acidification, inhibiting gastrin secretion.",

Parietal cell activation and the resultant acid secretory response is greater to a combination of agonists than the sum of the responses to the agents used singly. This increase in responsiveness is termed potentiation. Potentiating interactions are most apparent when the stimulants use different second messenger systems, for example, acetylcholine and histamine. Conversely, blockade of receptors to one stimulant also blocks responsiveness to the other agonist. Because of this interaction, blockade of histamine receptors by agents like cimetidine decreases responsiveness to acetylcholine. Blockage of acetylcholine release by vagotomy decreases responsiveness to histamine secreted by gastric mast cells. Both vagotomy and histamine2 receptor antagonists decrease basal acid secretion by approximately 80%.",

        "explanation": "Because the gastric mucosa is metabolically highly active, control of gastric mucosal blood flow is of great physiologic significance. Almost all stimuli that increase acid secretion also increase gastric blood flow. A large number of gastrointestinal hormones stimulate gastric blood flow, most because of their ability to increase acid secretion. Thus, gastrin is a potent stimulant of blood flow, in proportion to its ability to increase acid secretion. Vagal nerve stimulation has the net effect of increasing mucosal and total gastric blood flow; sympathetic nerve stimulation is accompanied by opposite effects. Prostaglandins are important endogenous regulators of gastric blood flow. Prostaglandins of the E class increase blood flow at doses that suppress acid secretion. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase activity by indomethacin causes a reduction in resting gastric blood flow.",

Misoprostol, a derivative of prostaglandin E, causes endoscopic healing in 60% of patients at 4 weeks. The major side effect of misoprostol is diarrhea due to effects upon gut smooth muscle contractility. Uterine bleeding has been reported in some women using the drug and the agent has potential abortifacient actions. For this reason, misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnancy.

H pylori infestation of antral mucosa is believed to cause gastritis. While normal small intestinal cells do not permit H pylori binding, areas of gastric metaplasia are usually demonstrated in the duodenal mucosa immediately surrounding the ulcer. Resolution of gastritis follows eradication of the organism and drug regimens that are bactericidal are associated with lower rates of ulcer recurrence than those that have no anti-bacterial actions. However, it is clear that not all patients infested with H pylori develop ulceration.

Bismuth compounds act locally and achieve gastric concentrations above the MIC for 90% of H pylori isolates. Metronidazole is secreted into the stomach at high concentration, and the in vivo activity of metronidazole is not diminished by gastric acidity. Triple therapy with bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline or amoxicillin eradicates H pylori in 90% of cases, compared to 0% eradication with ranitidine. Inclusion of an H2 receptor antagonist or omeprazole has been reported to increase efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.

Because of the high likelihood of complications from giant gastric ulcer, early operation is the treatment of choice. The operation of choice is resection, including the ulcer. If the ulcer has penetrated adjacent structures and cannot be dissected free, the stomach wall can be incised circumferentially, leaving the ulcer intact and behind, and the gastric resection completed.",

Only 5% of gastric ulcers are found on the greater curvature. In addition, 97% of all gastric ulcers occur within 2 cm of the junctional zone between fundic and antral mucosa. Gastric ulcers appear at different distances from the pyloric sphincter because the antrum extends for variable (2 to 16 cm) distances from the pylorus. It is interesting that with increasing age this junctional zone moves proximally along the lesser curvature, as does the incidence of gastric ulcer.",

In addition to serving as a lubricant, mucus also enhances mucosal defense by forming an unstirred layer overlying the epithelial surface. In humans, the thickness of this gel layer has been reported to be about 500 µm. The vacuoles containing mucus in the cytosol of the surface epithelial cell are released by cholinergic stimulation and prostaglandins. Synthesis and release are inhibited by aspirin-like compounds that inhibit cyclooxygenase. Gel mucus retards proton mobility by a factor of only three or four, a degree that is inadequate to maintain a near neutral pH at the apical membrane of the surface epithelial cell. In addition to producing mucus, the gastric surface epithelial cells secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid. The amount of bicarbonate secreted is about 5% to 10% of the amount of acid that the same surface of mucosa can produce. As with mucus, bicarbonate secretion is stimulated by cholinergic agents and prostaglandins and inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The release of bicarbonate into the gel mucus provides a significant mucosal defense by maintaining a near neutral acid-base milieu at the apical membrane of the surface epithelial cells. When the luminal pH is around 3.0, the apical membrane of the surface epithelial cell may be exposed to a pH of about 5.0.",

Correct identification of the bleeding source is made in greater than 90% of instances. If endoscopy is not diagnostic, visceral angiography through selective catheterization of the left gastric or splenic vessels may provide information regarding the primary vessel supplying the bleeding site.

In a study of 100 seriously ill patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or antacid prophylaxis, bleeding was detected in 25% of patients given no prophylaxis, compared to 4% of patients given antacids through the nasogastric tube. In a review of data derived from 16 prospective trials, when overt bleeding manifested by melena, hematemesis, or transfusion requirement was used as the minimum criterion, there was no significant difference in risk of bleeding, comparing antacids and cimetidine. Continuous infusions of any of the H2-receptor antagonists provides more consistent maintenance of an intraluminal gastric pH of greater than 3.5 than do the standard intermittent-infusion regimens. Advantages of continuous infusion of these agents include a potential reduction in toxicity, decreased pharmacy costs and nursing duties, and possible enhancement of therapeutic benefit. Controlled trials suggest that sucralfate, 1 g every 6 hours, may be as effective as antacids or cimetidine prophylactically. In 100 critically ill patients, bleeding occurred in 6% of patients receiving antacids or cimetidine, while none of the 34 patients on sucralfate bled.

Definitive treatment of ongoing acute active stress bleeding by antacids is largely unsuccessful. Administration of H2-receptor blocking agents once active gastrointestinal bleeding has commenced is also usually ineffective as a definitive form of therapy. The endoscope has become the preferred therapeutic as well as diagnostic instrument with electrocautery and laser photocoagulation capabilities.

The failure rates (loss of less than 40% excess weight) for horizontal gastroplasty procedures ranges from 40% to 70%. The vertical banded gastroplasty (VBGP) is a procedure in which a stapled opening is made in the stomach with the stapling device 5 cm from the cardioesophageal junction.

Increasing numbers of patients are treated with chemoradiation therapy alone. The risk of hemorrhage or perforation was frequently alluded to in the past and has probably been overstated. The risk of perforation in primary gastric lymphomas that are treated with cytolytic agents in unresected patients approximates 5%.",

Proximal gastric lesions or larger middle stomach lesions may require total gastrectomy or esophagogastrectomy to encompass the tumor. Regardless of the extent of gastric resection, patients with more advanced tumors fare poorly because of the increased likelihood of lymphatic and hematogenous spread. The TNM system is shown in Table 25-2. Five-year survival for stage I patients (in situ carcinoma) is close to that of the normal population.

Lesions with more than 5 to 10 mitoses per 10 high-power fields demonstrate increased metastasis. Intraperitoneal sarcomatosis is frequent, as is local recurrence after resection. Metastasis occurs by way of the hematogenous route, and thus hepatic involvement is common. Lymphatic metastasis is observed in less than 10% of patients.

Clearance of these secretions is hampered by the inability to cough, perhaps secondary to the pain of thoracotomy or abdominal surgery or by a decrease in the number of ciliary cells that help move mucus up the tracheobronchial tree.

This procedure probably is not indicated for cancer patients with acute pneumonitis, as broad-spectrum antibiotics frequently are successful treatments. For those who do require the procedure, the choice between VATS and thoracotomy is determined by the severity of illness. In those who are critically ill and ventilator dependent, changing the tube to an endobronchial tube for thoracoscopy may be risky, and in these cases an anterior thoracotomy with single-lumen ventilation is indicated. These patients, who are frequently heavily sedated and are likely to remain so for some time postoperatively, are unlikely to benefit from the greatest advantage of VATS, the reduction of postoperative pain. It is, then, the ambulatory patient with a chronic interstitial process who benefits the most from the VATS approach.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Use of an endotracheal tube, of course, avoids a stoma and related complications. Cuff lesions, however, are incurred from cuffs on endotracheal tubes, cricothyroidostomy tubes, and tracheostomy tubes. A cuff is the common factor. Endotracheal tubes, on the other hand, cause erosion at the level of the glottis and subglottis, in particular. Although many factors may play some role in the origin of airway stenosis, the principal factor is pressure necrosis of the mucosa, submucosa, and ultimately of the cartilage, with subsequent cicatrization. Large endotracheal tubes do, indeed, cause necrosis and airway injury at narrow areas in the upper airway, at glottic and cricoid levels. Such injuries lead to posterior commissure stenosis, arytenoid fixation, vocal cord erosion and granulomas, anterior commissure stricture, and subglottic circumferential stenosis. While excision of a large amount of tracheal wall can lead inevitably to healing by contraction with narrowing of the tracheal circumference, the most usual cause of stomal stenosis is erosion of the stoma by pressure from the tracheostomy tube. This in turn may relate to leverage by equipment. Additional factors appear to be subsidiary. A large volume, low pressure tracheostomy tube cuff, such as those currently available, if properly constructed, will seal the trachea before it is necessary to stretch the cuff by adding an increasing volume of air. If the cuff is stretched beyond that resting volume, which usually occludes the normal trachea, high pressures will develop because the plastic material from which all of these cuffs are now made is not very extensible. Therefore, the pressure-volume curve rises sharply once the limit of unstretched volume is passed. A low-pressure cuff then becomes a high-pressure cuff.",

          "E"
        ],
        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Emergency management of postintubation tracheal stenosis is accomplished by dilatation under general anesthesia using rigid bronchoscopes and dilators. Tracheostomy is employed only when the patient requires a prolonged or a permanent airway before or instead of resection and reconstruction. If a new tracheostomy is needed it is preferable to place it through the area of existing stenosis—in this case the site of prior tracheostomy—rather than to injure normal trachea that will be needed for resection and reconstruction. If the stenosis is below the sternal notch, a long tracheostomy tube is inserted at the usual position (second and third rings) but extends past the now dilated stenotic lesion. Lasering almost never results in a permanently satisfactory airway; the exception is the very limited lesion described as a thin, weblike stenosis. Such lesions are rare. Unfortunately, laser is widely used and often compounds existing damage by concurrent placement of a tracheostomy tube below the lesion in the normal trachea. T-tubes are very useful for temporizing when repair is not possible or must be delayed. It almost never leads to resolution of a stricture unless it is an extremely limited one. Soon after removal of the T-tube the stricture reasserts itself. If the lesion involves the subglottic larynx, complex repair is required to preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerve's anatomy and function. The posterior cricoid plate is salvaged and resurfaced with a flap of membranous tracheal wall; the anterior subglottic larynx is reconstructed with a “prow” of distal tracheal cartilage and mucosa. A tracheoesophageal fistula is managed (after weaning from a respirator) by layered closure of the esophagus, interposition of a flap of well-vascularized tissue (such as a pedicled strap muscle), and resection and reconstruction of the damaged trachea. Since the fistula results from the pressure of a cuff, often against an esophageal feeding tube, there is circumferential damage to the trachea at the level of the fistula. Resection and reconstruction are therefore necessary, in addition to closure of the fistula, for successful treatment of this complex lesion.",

Gram-negative rods and staphylococci are particularly common in hospital-acquired infections. These organisms are almost always penicillin sensitive. Surgical therapy is rarely necessary to eradicate a pyogenic lung abscess. Penicillin, alone or in combination with metronidazole, is the drug of choice.

CT of the chest, liver, and adrenals is performed to confirm the location of the tumor, to evaluate the mediastinum, and to assess the abdomen for systemic disease. If there is no evidence of metastases on CT, the patient should undergo bronchoscopy, which may establish the histologic diagnosis and determine resectability if an endobronchial lesion exists. Pulmonary function studies are obtained preoperatively to assess the potential for pulmonary resection. A thorough review of systems is undertaken to rule out medical contraindications to thoracotomy.

Pectus excavatum, or funnel chest, is the most common of the congenital deformities of the chest wall, accounting for 90% of such defects. It is characterized by a concave, posteriorly displaced sternum due to overgrowth of the costal cartilages. Most commonly the defect begins at the junction of the manubrium and the body of the sternum and becomes progressively deeper toward the xiphoid. The manubrium and the first and second costal cartilages typically are normal. The defects have both physiologic and psychologic consequences and are often associated with other abnormalities, including congenital heart disease, Marfan's syndrome, and other skeletal defects, including scoliosis. Patients most often present because of the cosmetic defect but frequently are found to have other symptoms, including impaired cardiopulmonary function and scoliosis. Pulmonary complaints include dyspnea and respiratory tract infections. Restrictive alterations in chest wall mechanics and abnormalities in pulmonary function tests, including decreased vital capacity, decreased total lung capacity, decreased maximal ventilatory volume, and decreased maximal breathing capacity, have been documented.",

A sternotomy is required infrequently, even in those patients with a mediastinal parathyroid gland. Most often the adenomas are found embedded in or near the superior pole of the thymus. Mediastinal paraganglioma may produce significant catecholamines, predominantly norepinephrine. Catecholamine production causes a classic group of symptoms associated with pheochromocytomas, including periodic sustained hypertension often accompanied by orthostatic hypotension, and hypermetabolism manifested by weight loss, hyperhydrosis, palpitation, and headaches.

Although radical resection of tumor is indicated for thymoma, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the modalities used for the treatment of patients with lymphomas and germ cell tumors.

Useful techniques for identifying less symptomatic patients who have significant airway compression include CT imaging and pulmonary function tests. A reduction of the tracheal diameter by more than 35% on a CT scan and reduction of peak expiratory flow during pulmonary function testing are sensitive indicators of functional airway compression. In patients with airway compression and superior vena caval obstruction, the risk of general anesthesia is significant. Attempts to obtain a histologic diagnosis should be limited to needle biopsies or open procedures performed under local anesthesia. In situations in which histologic diagnosis cannot be obtained using these methods, therapy may be initiated with radiation, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy. However, a histologic diagnosis may not be obtainable in as many as 40% of these patients after initiation of treatment. Some proceed with biopsy of the mediastinal mass under general anesthesia. However, alterations in anesthetic management include: (1) induction of anesthesia in a semi-Fowler's or upright position, (2) availability of rigid bronchoscopy to allow reestablishment of an adequate airway, (3) use of a long endotracheal tube to allow advancement of the tube beyond the site of obstruction, (4) avoidance of muscle relaxants and the use of spontaneous ventilation when possible, (5) lower extremity intravenous cannulation, and (6) standby cardiopulmonary bypass.",

In contrast, 62% of the symptomatic patients had a malignant neoplasm during this period. A number of intrathoracic and extrathoracic lesions may have an appearance similar to a primary mediastinal mass on routine chest films, as do a large number of cardiovascular lesions. Although angiography was used in the past for this differentiation, CT with contrast and MRI now distinguish a primary mediastinal mass from a cardiovascular lesion. Tru-cut needle biopsy of a cardiovascular lesion may be associated with significant hemorrhagic complications. Seminomas rarely produce beta–human chorionic gonadotropin and never produce alpha-fetoprotein. In contrast, over 90% of the nonseminomas secrete one or both of these hormones.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Acute suppurative mediastinitis is a classic wound problem and forms a paradigm for principles of management. Wide débridement is perhaps the most important step in correcting this type of invasive wound sepsis. Drainage requires removal of tissue with vascular compromise. Tissue that is infected and can serve as an ongoing nidus for infection, particularly cartilage, must be removed. Irrigation is effective only when the irrigation fluid reaches into and flushes out débris and bacteria. The irrigation is insufficient if only dilutional and not also mechanically effective. Since infected tissue tends to become isolated from the systemic circulation the direct application of antibacterials reaches avascular areas. Some, such as silver sulfadiazine, penetrate avascular tissue better than, for instance, ointments or povidone iodine, and such an agent should be chosen. Wide débridement and the washing of debris with pressure irrigation make the wound then available to topical applications, which are often best packed into these deep, irregular cavities. Long-term systemic antibacterials serve no purpose and lead to potential resistant bacterial overgrowth. Although systemic antibacterials provide a measure of protection up to the margin where vascularized and nonvascularized tissues meet, topical agents are better in the actual infected site. Once closed, these wounds rapidly become sterilized. Even the infection at the bone level is far different from traditional osteomyelitis, and long-term systemic therapy is unnecessary. Muscle flaps are a great advance in closure technique, since they provide bulky protection, obliterate dead space, and help vascularize the wound.",

Their introduction into a contaminated wound, however, would more likely promote rather than reduce infection. Various meshes and other types of “protection” devices are not necessary. Skin flaps alone do not obliterate dead space and have not been shown either to reduce or resist infection. The rectus abdominis muscle is a superb source of readily available tissue that can be rotated into very large cavities. The nature of the muscle allows it to be “dressed into” irregular cavities. It has an excellent, easily movable skin territory overlying it, which can also be transferred if locally available skin is wanting. The omentum has the great ability to fit into the many irregularities of some defects. For appropriately selected cases it is excellent. The pectoralis major muscle flaps are the usual initial choice since they are in the operative field. When the musculotendinous insertion is released their mobility is often sufficient. Additionally, it avoids the need for abdominal incisions. The latissimus dorsi muscle as a flap is dependable and includes sternal defects in the scope of its arc of rotation. It requires rotating the patient on the operating table and thus is less readily available than the other flaps.",

The carcinoid syndrome is rarely found except in the presence of a large primary tumor or hepatic metastases.

Hypoxemia may be secondary to the mechanical effects of the tumor producing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. The latter can be confirmed by V/Q lung scan which also serves to identify areas of functioning lung in patients with marginal pulmonary function. The best screening test for adequacy of pulmonary reserve is the FEV1. It identifies obstructive pulmonary disease which is more important than the restrictive lung disease identified by vital capacity measurement. Diffusion capacity measurement provides little additional information of value.",

        "explanation": "Although mediastinal granulomatous disease is one cause of the superior vena cava syndrome described, the most common cause (75%) is malignant disease. A venogram adds little information to the typical findings and increases risk from extravasation of contrast medium subcutaneously from the venous hypertension. Mediastinoscopy can be used for diagnosis with recognition of increased risk of bleeding and airway problems from the edema associated with the endotracheal intubation required for the procedure. If a malignancy is found, operative resection is usually precluded by the extent of mediastinal invasion. Fortunately, in the case of benign disease, the symptoms tend to improve with time as chest wall and mediastinal collaterals enlarge.",

Despite the practice of organ transplantation for more than 30 years, the role of histocompatibility typing in transplantation is controversial. Although grafts between HLA-matched donors and recipients exhibit better survival than HLA-mismatched grafts, matching is not routinely performed before transplantation of the heart or liver, and the outcome of these grafts may be very good.

This interaction is enhanced by the co-ordinate binding of CD4 or CD8 to the MHC antigen complex. This interaction initiates signaling through CD3, as well as through CD4 or CD8, both of which are associated with tyrosine kinases. Full activation of the T cell also requires the delivery of “co-stimulatory” signals. These signals may arise through the interaction of CD28 expressed by the T cell with B7-1 or B7-2 expressed on antigen-presenting cells. If only the T-cell antigen receptor is stimulated (and co-stimulation is not provided) the T-cell becomes anergic, that is, resistant to further stimulation.

Although allograft rejection in naive recipients is mediated predominantly by cells, antidonor antibodies can cause very severe types of rejection, including hyperacute and acute vascular rejection. Antidonor antibodies or cellular responses may contribute to the development of chronic rejection, which is now the most common cause of graft loss. Recent studies demonstrate that helper T cells may differentiate along one of two pathways. The Th1 pathway leads to secretion of interferon-gamma and other cytokines and is associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity and allograft rejection. The Th2 pathway is associated with secretion of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-4 and may actually inhibit alloimmune responses. The development of Th2 responses may thus contribute to tolerance. Like allograft rejection, tolerance is highly specific. Thus, a person who is tolerant to one antigen or one individual is still able to mount an immune response against other antigens and other individuals.",

RTAS is responsible for hypertension in 4% to 12% of renal allograft recipients. It responds well to percutaneous angioplasty.

To use all the organs requires the capability to preserve them for at least 24 hours. It has been shown that most organs can be matched to a recipient within about 17 to 24 hours. For all but the heart and lung, most intra-abdominal organs tolerate preservation for 20 to 30 hours and perform as well as those preserved for 4 to 8 hours. Although undue delay should not be purposefully used, certainly, most organ transplants do not need to be done on an emergency basis. However, this is not true for hearts and lungs, which should be transplanted as quickly as possible. 34. Which of the following statements about hepatic artery thrombosis following liver transplantation is/are correct? DISCUSSION: Thrombosis of the hepatic artery remains one of the most serious early complications of liver transplantation. This complication is three to five times more common in children than in adults. The major cause of this complication is related to technical error, although the hypercoagulable state may play a significant role in some situations. Early thrombosis of the hepatic artery leads to rapid liver failure with a fatal outcome unless a transplant can be performed within 36 to 72 hours. Although thrombolytic therapy through percutaneous or surgical access can be successful, most of these patients require retransplantation. Stenosis of the hepatic artery or late thrombosis of the hepatic artery can lead to multiple intrahepatic strictures of the bile duct and/or hepatic abscesses. This complication also often requires retransplantation. Portal vein thrombosis is a rarer complication. It is a devastating condition when it occurs early, but can be tolerated well if it develops after several months. Portal hypertension due to late portal vein thrombosis can often be treated successfully by a shunt procedure.",

One of the major prognostic factors is the cause of the liver disease. Early admission to an intensive care unit and management by physicians experienced in liver transplantation are mandatory. The major cause of death in these patients is cerebral edema. In patients who rapidly develop coma, subdural intracerebral pressure monitoring is mandatory for optimal management as well as for identification of patients who can benefit from liver transplantation.

If UW (University of Wisconsin) solution and a good flushout technique is used in an acceptable donor, amylase is usually elevated only several hundred points and will decline in a day or two. Rejection of the pancreas can also cause elevated serum amylase and is usually accompanied by a rise in the creatinine value due to concomitant renal transplant rejection. Reflux pancreatitis is generally caused by bladder dysfunction: increased pressure transmitted back through the pancreatic ducts causes pancreatitis. It is generally relieved by bladder decompression with a Foley catheter. Naturally, leakage from the anastomosis of the pancreas transplant to the bladder causes absorption of amylase from the peritoneal cavity and an elevated serum amylase value. Constipation causes a rise in the amylase level of pancreas-kidney transplant recipients, for reasons that remain unclear. Native pancreatitis has to be borne in mind in the differential diagnosis of hyperamylasemia in transplant patients.

Subsequent multicenter trials showed improvement but not cure of the disease and substantial post-operative morbidity, so the technique was not recommended for widespread use. Excellent synthetic hormone replacement is available for thyroid insufficiency, so implantation of the thyroid gland in the forearm is not necessary. However, parathyroid hormone replacement is not available, and medical therapy for hypoparathyroidism is complicated. When parathyroid tissue is removed it should be autografted to prevent the deficiency symptoms of tetany, psychological disturbances, convulsions, coma and death. One-millimeter pieces may be implanted into pockets in the sternocleidomastoid muscle. When all glands are removed for diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia, implantation of fragments into the forearm muscles facilitates subsequent removal of more tissue under local anesthesia if hyperparathyroidism persists. Autotransplantation is the treatment of choice for undescended testes. The cryptorchid or ectopic testicle must be taken out of the abdomen and placed into a cooler location prior to age 6 (preferably at 1 year) for normal spermatogenesis to occur. Approximately half of the pancreatic islet transplants performed after pancreatectomy for relief of chronic pancreatitis pain have produced patients who are insulin independent. Islets for autotransplantation are difficult to isolate in sufficient quantities from the fibrotic adult pancreas.

The advantages of a mucosal lining, serosal covering, natural opening into the stomach, and excellent blood supply based on the gastroepiploic vessels make the stomach the autograft of choice in most situations.",

        "explanation": "There are, in principal, three options in managing the exocrine secretions following pancreatic transplant. In the first option, maintenance of exocrine secretions by internal drainage of the exocrine pancreas can be achieved by anastomosing the ductal system to either the intestinal tract (stomach, small intestine) or the urinary tract (ureter, bladder). These techniques are the most common in use today and provide the best overall results. The second technique, free drainage of the pancreatic juice into the peritoneal cavity, is certainly the least technically demanding method of transplantation. It is, however, associated with many other complications. Ablation of the exocrine secretion, the third option, can be accomplished by two techniques. The first, duct ligation, has been associated with exocrine atrophy and extensive fibrosis, usually resulting eventually in endocrine insufficiency. Ductal ligation has also had unpredictable effects on the exocrine tissue, associated with a high risk of acute pancreatitis and peripancreatic sepsis. The other method of ductal ligation involves injecting the pancreatic system with a synthetic polymer that solidifies within several minutes, with a result that exocrine secretion is completely blocked. The enterically drained pancreas (without duodenum) has in the past been associated with a significant incidence of anastomatic leakage, leading to pancreatic fistula, perigraft abscess, and systemic sepsis. Many of these allografts had to be removed. These problems can be oveated to a large extent if the donor duodenum (removed in block with the pancreas) is used to establish anastomosis. The bladder drainage technique greatly facilitates early diagnosis of rejection by providing a means to measure the output of amylase from the graft, as determined by the urinary amylase activity. Regardless of the type of graft transplanted (either whole organ or segmental), most transplant surgeons agree that graft should be placed intraperitoneally. The extensive surface of the peritoneum is probably of considerable help in absorbing the exudate that escapes from the surface of the pancreas. The incidence of anastomatic leaks and wound complications has been greatly reduced with the intraperitoneal placement of grafts.",

        "explanation": "The major principle of immunosuppression is to induce the patient with high doses of drugs at the time of allografting in order to prophylax rejection. The drugs are then reduced rapidly within a period of days to weeks to less toxic maintenance levels. The anti-metabolite azathioprine (Imuran) interferes with nucleic acid metabolism inhibiting proliferation and clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes, eliminating alloantigen specific immune responses. This agent is used during induction immunosuppression and for maintenance immunosuppression but has little role for treating an acute, ongoing rejection. Glucocorticoids are the mainstays of virtually all immunosuppressive regimens. All glucocorticoids have similar immunosuppressive actions and none is more effective than any other at equipotent doses. Complications and side effects are equivalent at all equipotent doses. Cyclosporine inhibits the rotamase activity of cyclophilin. Therefore the major immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporine is to block transcription of several early T-cell activation genes. The macrolide antibiotic, FK-506 is 10-100 times more potent than cyclosporine on a molar basis but it too is associated with a number of significant and similar toxicities. Antibodies are given for only short periods of time to prophylax rejection and to treat acute ongoing rejection. There are two major types of antibody preparations—polyclonal antibodies such as antilymphocyte (ALG) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or monoclonal antibodies. The only monoclonal antibody currently available is OKT3 which is the used for both induction and treatment of rejection and is the most efficacious agent currently available for the treatment of rejection.",

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a common indication for transplantation since there is no other effective treatment. The common association with inflammatory bowel disease can somewhat complicate the timing of the procedure, however, in general hepatic transplantation does not affect the outcome of the ulcerative colitis. Non-A, non-B hepatitis is the most common form of hepatitis leading to liver transplantation. Recurrence of viral hepatitis in the transplanted liver occurs, but usually follows an indolent course. Biliary atresia is by far the most common indication for hepatic transplantation in pediatric patients. Recommended treatment includes creation of a portoenterostomy (Kasai procedure), if this can be done before three months of age. After this point, success rates diminish markedly. Patients without a satisfactory course, multiple revisions of the portoenterostomy should be avoided to facilitate subsequent transplantation. The most common cause of fulminant hepatic failure are non-A, non-B hepatitis, hepatitis B, and various drug toxicities. In the latter group, acetaminophen toxicity is particularly prominent. Primary hepatic malignancy, most often hepatoma, is sometimes an indication for transplantation but the results are usually worse than in other disease states because of recurrent disease. Transplantation is justified in the occasional case in which the tumor is central but relatively small, if the patient is otherwise healthy, and there is no evidence of extrahepatic disease after exhaustive evaluation.",

        "explanation": "Performing single-lung transplantation in a patient with pulmonary hypertension has been particularly illustrative in demonstrating the potential for reversal of right ventricular dysfunction. As soon as the lung is implanted, the morphology of the right ventricular changes significantly as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography. The intraventricular septum, previously bulging into the left ventricle, immediately assumes the normal position. An increase in contractility of the right ventricle occurs with significant decrease in dilatation. The pulmonary artery pressure immediately decreases and is essentially normal by the time the patient leaves the operating room. One would also expect significant ventilation perfusion mismatch to occur with ventilation to the native lung occurring preferentially because the native lung is significantly more compliant. Conversely, perfusion should preferentially go to the newly transplanted lung because of lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Despite this occurrence, patients with this operation do well from a functional standpoint. By three months after transplantation, the ventilation/perfusion mismatch narrows. Despite this mismatch, patients do not demonstrate carbon dioxide retention. From a clinical standpoint, improvement in pulmonary function is seen almost immediately after transplantation. The measurement most often used is FEV1 and marked improvement is seen within two weeks. The FEV1 essentially triples and then remains fairly stable. Improvement after bilateral lung transplant is slightly better. Although patients who receive two lungs may do better on pulmonary function tests, this benefit is not translated to significantly better exercise capability.",

The central position of the MHC in immune regulation suggests that HLA matching is also very important for allografting. There is significant data to prove that HLA matching is important for kidney and pancreas transplantation. There is good data also to show that HLA matching is not important for liver transplantation and does not affect graft survival. The main loci typed are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR. Thus, for a normal completely heterozygous individual this results in six antigens typed and a complete donor-recipient match is referred to as a six-antigen match. An important test for graft compatibility is the cross match. This assay determines if there are preformed antibodies in the potential recipient’s serum which will react with antigens on the cell surface of the potential donor’s lymphocytes. A positive cross-match means that such antibodies are present and that hyperacute rejection will ensue if the transplant were to be performed. Another important test which is also a reflection of the presence of host anti-donor antibodies is the panel reactive antibody (PRA). Most recipients on transplant lists send serum samples to the transplant center on a regular basis which are tested against a panel of typing cells of known HLA specificities. Most individuals should have no anti-HLA antibodies and have a low PRA (0–5%). Patients who have been transfused, pregnant, previously transplanted, or have an autoimmune disorder which induces a lot of antibodies might have a high PRA (50–99%). The presence of a very high PRA suggests that a patient is likely to have a positive cross-match.",

        "explanation": "Primary nonfunction of the allograft occurs in about 5% to 10% of transplanted livers. Most cases of nonfunction are related to inadequate tissue preservation or occult organ dysfunction in the donor but a sizeable percentage may arise from immunologic mechanisms. In the worst case scenario, the patient does not regain consciousness, a coagulopathy ensues, and multiple organ failure develops. Liver enzymes show hepatocellular injury with SGOT and SGPT values in the range of 5000 to 10,000 and little bile production. Hepatic artery thrombosis occurs in 5% of adult hepatic transplantation cases and up to 25% of pediatric cases. Postoperative vein thrombosis is much less common than hepatic artery thrombosis, occurring in 2% to 3% of cases. Laparotomy to control postoperative bleeding is required in 15% of cases. In about half of the reoperations, a specific bleeding point is identified. Survival is higher in these cases in contrast to those in which diffuse bleeding is encountered, presumably since the latter circumstance is usually associated with poor allograft function and resultant coagulopathy. If significant bleeding occurs after hepatic transplantation, a common and sensible policy is to transfuse the patient until hypothermia and coagulopathy are corrected with subsequent (one to three days) evacuation of blood from the peritoneal cavity. Biliary leakage is a feared complication, with a high (50%) mortality. The high mortality may be the result of a concomitant hepatic arterial thrombosis and infection of the leaked bile, or difficulty of bile duct repair in the area of inflamed tissue.",

        "explanation": "The use of living-related donor renal transplant has multiple advantages including improved short-and long-term graft survival, routine immediate allograft function, and fewer rejection and infectious episodes. Nearly all transplantation centers that perform living-related donor transplantations report one-year graft survival rates of over 90%. The use of preconditioning of the recipient with donor-specific blood transfusions from their living donor can improve graft survival. The major drawback to this maneuver is the development of recipient anti-donor antibodies (sensitization) which occurs in nearly one-third of recipients. The development of sensitizing antibodies eliminates the use of that donor. With the introduction of cyclosporine, the use of donor-specific transfusions with subsequent immunosuppression, was compared to nontransfused recipients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. These investigations have demonstrated excellent graft survival rates over long-term follow-up and therefore routine donor-specific transfusions are seldom performed in adults. In the azathioprine and prednisone immunosuppression era, several immunologic and nonimmunologic risk factors were identified as having an adverse effect on graft outcome. Historically, older renal allograft recipients (older than 50 years) did poorly compared with younger counterparts. Much of the graft loss was found to be associated with patient deaths, and usually was the result of overwhelming infection. With the cautious use of cyclosporine and prednisone, however, excellent patient and graft survival rates are now reported. Data from the azathioprine and prednisone era show a clear-cut benefit from improved graft survival after multiple random blood transfusions. More recent studies again showed no advantage to blood transfusion when cyclosporine is used. Since transfused patients have a risk of developing anti-HLA antibodies, these patients may become more difficult to undergo organ transplantation in a timely fashion.",

Kidney, heart, pancreas, and lung allografts are all susceptible to hyperacute rejection; however, liver grafts are relatively resistant to this process and are often transplanted across antibody differences and even across an ABO difference. Acute rejection usually occurs days to weeks after transplantation and is initiated by T-cell dependent immunity characterized microscopically by lymphocytic infiltration accompanied by plasma cells, eosinophils, and a few Mast cells or neutrophils. Chronic rejection usually occurs months to years after transplant. It is characterized by loss of normal histologic structure, fibrosis and atherosclerosis.

For decades, the primary solution used for cold storage preservation of kidneys was Euro-Collins solution. Recently, a new solution, UW solution, has been developed with ingredients designed to provide high-energy phosphate precursors, hydrogen ion buffering capacity, and anti-oxidant properties. Although the advantage of this solution over Euro-Collins solution for kidneys is unclear, UW solution is used as the preservation method of choice by nearly all programs performing hepatic and pancreatic transplantations. Both organs can reliably be stored for 24 hours. Kidneys can generally be safely stored for 36 to 48 hours before transplantation. Cardiac preservation has changed relatively little in recent years.

During this time 63% of all graft losses, 22% of deaths, and 74% of all acute rejection episodes occur. An acute rejection episode in a renal allograft recipient is the single most important clinical event determining both short and long-term graft survival. The post-transplant period that begins at six months and continues to the one year mark is the quiescent time with very few influential clinical events. Only 9% of all graft losses and 9% of all acute rejection episodes occur during this time period.",

        "explanation": "The characteristics of a suitable cadaveric organ donor can be divided into those that are general in nature and those that are organ-specific. Broadly stated, the general attributes of an acceptable organ donor include the establishment of a diagnosis of brain death, previously good general health, and relative hemodynamic stability from the time of the advanced precipitating brain death until organ procurement is complete. As experience has been gained with donors considerably less than ideal, it has become apparent that arbitrarily defined chronological age limits for organ donors are unnecessary. Active systemic infection is an absolute contraindication to organ donation. Documented positive blood cultures for known systemic infection that has not been completely eradicated rule out the potential organ donor because of risk of transmission of infection to an immunosuppressed recipient. Furthermore, all potential organ donors, regardless of whether they are considered high risk, should be tested for infection with human immunodeficiency virus as well as hepatitis B and C. Cancer, whether treated or not, has long been considered to contravene organ donation. The only exception to this rule has been the donor with a primary malignancy of the central nervous system. The condition of particular organs in great measure dictate their individual suitability for transplantation. Preexisting hepatic disease can usually be identified before organ procurement. A history of hepatitis or cirrhosis of any kind preclude donation. Although calculous biliary tract disease would appear at first blush to be a contraindication of hepatic procurement, prior cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis is not an absolute contraindication to liver donation.",

The advantages to simultaneous renal-pancreatic transplantation compared to a sequential procedure (renal followed by pancreatic) include 1) the recipient’s need to accept only one set of donor antigens; 2) the ability to monitor rejection of the pancreas by identifying the well-recognized signs of renal allograft rejection; 3) the immunosuppressive effect of uremia; 4) transportation in patients who have not been maintained on chronic immunosuppression; and 5) a single albeit longer anesthetic exposure. Of these advantages, the most important is the use of renal function as an early indicator of pancreatic graft rejection. The disadvantages of simultaneous renal-pancreatic transplantation include extensive surgery in a uremic diabetic patient and the potential adverse effect on renal allograft function as the result of a pancreatic complication. Ideally, pancreatic transplantation should be performed in patients who do not yet have, but are designed to develop, secondary complications to diabetes that are more serious than the potential side-effects of immunosuppression. In recipients of a pancreas after a kidney, the only risks of pancreatic transplant are related to the surgery since immunosuppression is already obligatory.",

As immunosuppression becomes stronger and more effective, the recipient’s ability to resist infection diminishes. Transplant recipients are susceptible both to typical bacterial infections (UTI, pneumonia, wound infections) and to infections with unusual organisms (fungus, virus, atypical bacteria). Immunosuppressives also block the inflammatory response to infection so that patients present with very subtle signs and symptoms or they present late in the infectious process. Another complication in allograft recipients is malignancy. The immunosuppressive drugs do not appear to be directly mitogenic or transforming, but rather probably suppress immune mechanisms which keep transformed cells in check. Squamous cell carcinomas of the exposed area of the skin are by far the most common malignancy. Lymphomas are the next most common tumor and are 10–100 times more common in transplant recipients than in the general population. These are usually non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas and are often related to malignant transformation by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Another complication of organ allografting is graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is usually self-limited as donor cells, stimulated by the host alloantigen, are eliminated either by immunosuppression or by host anti-donor responses.",

This can be particularly difficult in the presence of facial or laryngeal trauma, or in the unconscious patient with a suspected cervical spine injury. The mechanical removal of oral debris followed by the “chin lift” or “jaw thrust” maneuvers to relieve soft tissue obstruction of the pharynx are the first steps. However, when there is any question regarding the adequacy of the airway, or in the presence of severe head injury, or when the patient is in profound shock, more definitive airway control is required. In most patients this involves oral endotracheal intubation. However, the insertion of an oral endotracheal tube often involves hyperextension of the neck with the potential for aggravating cervical spine ligamentous or bony injury. Nasotracheal intubation is the preferred option for the patient with suspected cervical spine ligamentous or bony injury since the head and neck can be maintained in the neutral position with minimal manipulation. This technique requires a breathing patient, as the passage of air must be heard through the nasotracheal tube prior to its insertion through the larynx into the trachea. Nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in the presence of mid-face fractures. In this situation, a surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy, or needle cricothyroidotomy) is the preferred option.",

The difficulty in diagnosing cardiac contusions is that they remain a pathologic diagnosis, confirmed only at autopsy or on direct cardiac examination. The injury may vary from superficial epicardial petechiae to complete transmural damage. Although significant myocardial injuries, such as ventricular rupture, coronary vessel thrombosis, and valvular disruption, have been reported, the most common clinically significant result of cardiac contusion is the occurrence of arrhythmias. Hence, an initial electrocardiogram (ECG) and subsequent continuous cardiac monitoring for at least 24 hours is generally recommended. Alternative methods of diagnosing myocardial contusion include creatine phosphokinase cardiac isoenzymes (CPK-MB), two-dimensional echocardiography, gated ventricular scintigraphic angiography (GVA), radioactive thallous chloride ( 201Tl) uptake, and right ventricular monitoring. Unfortunately, none of these tests is adequately sensitive or specific in the diagnosis of cardiac contusion, and their correlation with the presence of arrhythmias or ECG changes is also imprecise.",

This classification is based on four factors: (1) abnormal physiologic signs, (2) anatomic area of injury, (3) mechanism of injury, and (4) concurrent or co-morbid disease states. Major physiologic abnormalities include a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 13, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm. Hg, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 29 per minute, or a Revised Trauma Score of less than 11 or a Pediatric Trauma Score of less than 9. Significant anatomic considerations include penetrating injuries to the torso, head and neck, and proximal extremities, flail chest, combination of trauma with burns to greater than 10% of body surface area, two or more proximal long bone fractures, pelvic fractures, paralysis, or traumatic amputation above the wrist or ankle. Significant mechanisms of injury include a death in the same passenger compartment or ejection from the automobile, high-impact (greater than 5 miles per hour) auto-pedestrian injuries, or a pedestrian thrown or run over. The co-morbid factors include pediatric or elderly (<5 or >55) patients or known history of insulin-dependent diabetes or cardiac, respiratory, or psychotic disorders. These criteria should serve as guidelines for medical control and the pre-hospital care providers. Such triage guidelines have been shown to produce the triage of only a small fraction (5% to 10%) of all injured patients to Level I or Level II trauma centers.",

Head injury itself rarely produces hypotensive shock. It is only in the terminal phases of brain death that hypotension may be attributable to head injury alone. Therefore, hypotension in trauma patients must be assumed to be secondary to volume depletion or ongoing hemorrhage. An occult site of hemorrhage (chest, abdomen, pelvis, retroperitoneum, or extremities) must be strongly suspected and dealt with accordingly. A rapid and complete neurologic assessment is a crucial part of the initial assessment of all trauma patients. This initial exam gives an excellent indication of injury severity and prognosis. Since the ultimate outcome of a brain injury is dependent on adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, adequate airway control, ventilation, hemorrhage control, volume restitution, and arterial oxygenation are crucial factors in the early management of head injuries.",

Therefore, the first priority in assessing and managing the patient with maxillofacial trauma is to assess and assure the adequacy of the airway. The face is typically divided into thirds when defining injuries. Injuries to the upper third of the face are often accompanied by ocular or central nervous system complications as well as facial deformities. Fractures of the orbital roof are frequently associated with frontal sinus and nasal ethmoid fractures, and are accompanied by a loss of upward gaze due to involvement of the superior rectus muscle. However, the most common cause of loss of upward gaze is orbital floor injury and associated entrapment of the globe or injury to the inferior rectus muscle. Middle third of facial structures include the maxilla, zygoma, orbits, and nose. The Le Fort classifications of facial fractures are commonly employed to describe these complex fracture lines. In a Le Fort II fracture, the superior fracture line is transverse through the nasal bones or through the articulation of the maxillary and nasal bones with the frontal bones. This is also known as the “pyramidal” fracture of the mid-face. The diagnosis is established by digital manipulation of the anterior maxilla and observation for mobility of the central triangle (the maxilla and nose).

The accuracy rates for DPL in several large collective series reveal an overall sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 98% to 99%, and overall accuracy of 97%. As result, DPL remains the mainstay for diagnosis of intraperitoneal injury in the trauma patient; however, not every trauma patient requires DPL. In the awake, alert, and responsive patient with isolated abdominal injuries, the physical examination and history are very helpful in predicting the presence of significant injury. In the patient with lower torso (nipples to pubis) or back or flank gunshot wounds, the incidence of intra-abdominal injury is so high that exploratory laparotomy without further diagnostic modalities is generally advocated. In addition, DPL is generally inaccurate in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal injuries (duodenum, renal, pancreas), and significant retroperitoneal hemorrhage in association with pelvic fractures produces a false-positive DPL rate of up to 30%. Computed tomography (CT) scans have proved extremely valuable in these situations. General recommendations for the use of abdominal CT scans in trauma victims include patients who are hemodynamically stable (normal) with (1) equivocal abdominal examination, (2) closed head injury, (3) spinal cord injury, (4) hematuria, and (5) pelvic fractures with significant bleeding. These five indications are appropriate if the patient is truly hemodynamically stable and the time required to perform CT does not delay any surgical procedures.",

Control of the airway in a patient with head, face, and neck injury can be extremely challenging. In the patient presented, the best option given for control of the airway is endotracheal intubation with in-line cervical traction. This requires at least two persons, one to maintain the head in the neutral position and one to insert the endotracheal tube under direct vision. An alternative in this case would be emergency cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy, or needle-jet insufflation. Nasotracheal intubation is not an option in the presence of a mid-face fracture and a nasal hemorrhage. Clearly, attention must also be directed at assuring adequacy of ventilation (potential right pneumothorax), assessing and treating obvious hemorrhage, determining if there is occult intra-abdominal or thoracic hemorrhage, and determining the patient's neurologic status. While management of these other issues can occur simultaneously, they do not take priority over securing an adequate airway. In this patient the airway is so tenuous that time should not be spent obtaining a cross-table cervical spine film and chest film prior to definitive control of the airway.",

Each year more than 140,000 Americans die of injuries, 50,000 due to motor vehicle accidents. Just over 50% of motor vehicle injuries involve intoxicated drivers. Injury prevention would be the most cost-effective method of dealing with this major social and economic burden. Active injury prevention strategies are those that require active continued cooperation on the part of the individual, such as wearing a helmet when driving a motorcycle or wearing seat belts in automobiles. Passive approaches such as fitting all motor vehicles with driver air bags require little or no individual cooperation and have clearly proved the more effective option, but active prevention strategies have repeatedly been demonstrated to reduce injury fatalities. States with seat belt and child restraining laws show an increase in seat belt use of more than 60% with a concurrent 9% to 12% reduction in occupant fatalities. Motor vehicle accidents are responsible for approximately 60% of spinal cord injuries, falls for 20% to 30%, and diving accidents for an addition 5% to 10%.

Accumulation of as little as 150 ml. of blood in the pericardium will sufficiently decrease diastolic filling to produce distended neck veins, cyanosis, and decreased cardiac output. Beck's classic triad of distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds, and hypotension is present in only one third of patients with tamponade. Pulsus paradoxicus is even less frequently discernible. Immediate temporary treatment consists of pericardiocentesis, which also provides a diagnosis. However, approximately 15% of pericardiocenteses give false-negative results because of a clotted hemopericardium. Therefore, echocardiography prior to needle aspiration is generally advisable if promptly available. In the patient in extremis, emergency thoracotomy with pericardiotomy and cardiac repair should be performed.

          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: In 1952 King and Schumaker suggested that children who had undergone splenectomy were at risk for the development of bacterial infections, and the syndrome of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis (OPSS) was suggested by Diamond in 1969. The syndrome is unlike fulminating bacteremias and septicemia in individuals with normal splenic function. The onset is sudden, with nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion leading to coma. The new infecting organism is a gram-positive organism in over half the cases, primarily Streptoccoccus pneumoniae. Blood cultures may occasionally demonstrate up to as many as 10 6 bacterial organisms per cu. mm. circulating in the bloodstream. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is common along with hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and shock unresponsive to antibiotics and fluid or pharmacologic support. Mortality has generally been reported as high as 50% and even up to 80% for pneumococcal infections. The true incidence of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis following a splenectomy from trauma is not well defined. Green and colleagues suggested that the risk of OPSS is 166 times the rate expected for the general population. Eraklis and Filler suggested that the incident rate of mortality from sepsis and OPSS is 78 times greater than that expected for the general population. Despite this increased frequency, overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis remains a rare event. Singer's large review of 688 children who had undergone splenectomy for trauma demonstrated only a 1.45% incidence of postsplenectomy sepsis, but a 40% mortality. The occurrence of OPSS appears to be less following splenectomy for trauma when compared with splenectomy for congenital hematologic disorders. Nonetheless, the recognition of the severe nature of this entity has prompted many trauma surgeons to more aggressively attempt splenic salvage. Animal laboratory evidence suggests that at least 50% of the splenic tissue mass must be preserved to prevent overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. The immunologic function of the spleen that appears to be most beneficial in preventing OPSS is the spleen's capacity for clearance of blood-borne particles and the provision of circulating opsins, which assist in cell-mediated immunologic functions.",

About half of all trauma-related deaths occur within seconds or minutes of injury and are related to lacerations of the aorta, heart, brain stem, brain, and spinal cord. Few of these patients are saved by health care systems, regardless of efficiency. The second mortality peak occurs within hours of injury and accounts for about 30% of deaths, half of which are due to hemorrhage and half due to central nervous system injuries. Important reductions in mortality during this period have resulted from the development of trauma and rapid transport systems. Overall, trauma mortality rates have been reduced from about 30% to 2% to 9% where well-organized trauma care systems exist. The third mortality peak includes deaths that occur one day after trauma to weeks later. This mortality rate is usually attributed to infection and multiple organ failure. Ten to 20% of trauma deaths occur during this period. The development of efficient trauma systems, however, has changed the epidemiology of these deaths. During the first week after trauma, refractory intracranial hypertension after severe head injury now accounts for a significant number of these deaths. The incidence of sepsis and multiple organ failure has diminished as the result of aggressive and better early resuscitation and care. Sepsis and multiple organ failure now account for about 5% of overall mortality and only 30% of late mortality where organized trauma systems exist.",

In the United States, injury is the leading cause of death in individuals less than 44 years and results in 70% of the total hospital admissions. Young males are the highest risk group, not because of physiologic distinctions, but because of their propensity to engage in high-risk activities. Although the three leading causes of traumatic death in all ethnic groups are motor vehicle accidents, homicide, and suicide, for individuals under 35 years of age, the order in which these occur differs. In the African-American population, the leading cause of death in this age group is homicide, while in all other groups it is motor vehicle accidents. Although morbidity and mortality figures are important, another important method of analyzing the toll injury places on a society is in years of productive life lost. Years of productive life lost is used to reflect the amount of productive working time lost due to premature death. Since injury is so prevalent in the younger population, a traumatic death in this age group will result in a large number of years of productive life lost, more so than deaths in the older age groups due to chronic diseases. In fact, years of productive life lost due to injury are approximately 40% higher than those found in cancer or heart disease patients, the second and third leading causes of productive life lost.",

Kinetic energy (KE) is a function of the mass (M) of an object and its velocity (V): KE = M x V^2 /2 It is clear from this relationship that changes in velocity alter the kinetic energy transferred more significantly than changes in mass. Therefore, a small child and a large adult, though significantly different in size and weight, are subjected to similar levels of energy transfer in a high-speed vehicular collision, the primary determinant being velocity rather than mass. The tolerance of a biologic tissue to traumatic injury is directly proportional to the elasticity of the organ—that is, its ability to return to its original shape and position. Elasticity is directly affected by the rate of loading, or the rate at which strain is applied to the tissues. Applying the force more rapidly increases the likelihood of exceeding tolerance. Blunt trauma results in two types of forces during impact. First, changes in speed (acceleration or deceleration) create shear strain, and second, deformity changes (stretch or compression) creates tensile strain.",

        "explanation": "A major cause of maxillofacial trauma are motor vehicle accidents. Facial skeletal fractures and soft tissue damage in the frontal, orbital, nasal, zygomatic, maxillary and mandibular regions are included. The frontal bone, which houses the frontal sinuses, is particularly strong due to its arched configuration as well as thick, hard bone. The amount of force necessary to fracture the frontal sinus is two to three times greater than that necessary for other facial bone fractures. Consistent fracture patterns from blows to the maxilla have been classified by LeFort and occur within and along the maxilla at its junction with weaker and aerated bone of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. The classic LeFort fractures are classified as LeFort I, LeFort II and LeFort III and are of increasing complexity and morbidity. The cribriform plate, ethmoidal arteries, optic nerve and internal maxillary artery are all vulnerable to injury with a LeFort III fracture. Soft tissue injuries of the face are encountered even more often than facial fractures. The facial nerve is the most important underlying structure at risk since blunt or penetrating trauma to the nerve or branches can cause complete or partial ipsilateral facial paralysis. The most common cause of facial nerve injury is fracture of the temporal bone, but injury can occur anywhere from the intracranial to the extracranial facial course of the nerve. After securing the airway and controlling life-threatening hemorrhage, the secondary survey including the facial area is carried out. The nose is inspected for deformity, pain, mobility, septal hematoma and obstruction. Bleeding should be managed immediately. Leakage of cerebral spinal fluid suggests a cribriform plate or ethmoidal fracture and a presence should warn against insertion of any nasal tubes or packing. Since CT scan is part of the standard management of the head-injured patient, sections of the facial skeleton can be obtained simultaneously, providing information on the extent of facial fractures in addition to the status of the brain. Axial and coronal sections (obtained with the patient’s head hanging with the neck extended) are complimentary and are especially helpful in delineating the cribriform plate and ethmoid roof region, the orbital rims, and the overall vertical facial height.",

        "explanation": "Balanced salt solutions are the most commonly used resuscitative fluids, and their use to restore extracellular volume significantly decreases the transfusion requirement after hemorrhagic shock. Lactated Ringers and normal saline are the most effective crystalloid solutions in common use. Resuscitation with crystalloid require a volume administration ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 over volume lost. Although colloids do not replete the interstitial space, they have a volume-expanding effect somewhat greater than the amount used. Colloids commonly used for volume expansion in hypovolemia include albumen, dextran 70, dextran 40, and hydroxyethyl starch (hetastarch). Significant controversy exists concerning the use of crystalloid versus colloid resuscitation. Although the question has not been resolved, several recent studies have indicated an advantage to crystalloid in resuscitation. A meta-analysis of colloid versus crystalloid resuscitation after hemorrhagic shock has demonstrated a higher mortality rate in the colloid resuscitated patients, partly due to pulmonary complications. Patients who lose more than 25 to 30% of total blood volume will need blood for resuscitation. Type O, Rh-negative (universal donor blood) is immediately available without a cross match. Type-specific blood is available within most blood banks within five to ten minutes of receipt of the blood specimen, while the patient is being resuscitated with balanced salt solutions. Although not cross matched, this blood can be administered safely, and therefore its rapid availability and safety make type-specific blood the blood of choice for resuscitation in trauma. Autotransfusion involves the collection of shed blood and its reinfusion through a filter back into the patient. Autotransfused blood may produce disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and activation of fibrinolysis. In addition, blood collected from the peritoneal cavity after hollow viscus injury, even with cell washing, may lead to bacterial contamination of the autotransfused blood. Hypertonic solutions have been used in the resuscitation of patients after burn, shock, elective vascular surgery and trauma. In addition to volume expansion, hypertonic saline solutions have been shown to increase left ventricular performance, decrease peripheral resistance from arteriolar dilatation, and redistribute cardiac output to the kidneys and viscera. Perfluorocarbons are an experimental resuscitation fluid comprised of large, branched or cyclic aliphatic compounds which have the ability to dissolve and carry oxygen. Although effective in volume resuscitation with improved oxygen delivery and oxygen-carrying capacity, perfluorocarbon infusion has been shown to depress platelet counts, plasma immune globulin levels and depress other aspects of immune function.",

        "explanation": "Hemorrhage initiates both rapid and slower, more sustained compensatory responses. The body responds to maintain hemostasis almost immediately after the onset of hemorrhage. Decreased activation of the arterial baroreceptors, though a decrease in blood pressure or even more subtly, a decrease in pulse pressure, causes an increased sympathetic discharge, resulting in reflex tachycardia and vasoconstriction. Increased adrenergic output with increased secretion of catecholamines also leads to vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased myocardial contractility. Sustained compensatory responses include the release of vasoactive hormones and fluid shifts from the interstitium and the intracellular space. Adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction affects arterial precapillary and postcapillary sphincters and small veins and venules. The decrease in intravascular hydrostatic pressure distal to the precapillary sphincter leads to reabsorption of interstitial fluid into the vascular space and thereby functions to restore circulating volume. This is known as transcapillary refill. The increased release of stress hormones coupled with relative insulin resistance after shock leads to high extracellular glucose concentrations. In addition, products of anaerobic metabolism from hypoperfused cells accumulate in the extracellular compartment, inducing hyperosmolarity. This extracellular hyperosmolarity draws water from the intracellular space, increasing interstitial osmotic pressure, which in turn drives water, sodium and chloride across the capillary endothelium into the vascular space. If the shock state continues, however, the postcapillary sphincter remains in spasm, but the arteriolar and precapillary sphincters cannot maintain the tension, and they become relaxed. As sphincters relax, the capillary hydrostatic pressure increases and sodium, chloride and water move into the interstitium leading to further depletion of intravascular volume.",

After establishment of an airway, ventilation and appropriate pleural drainage, if necessary, the next priority is the assessment of the patient’s circulatory status. This includes an estimation of blood volume and cardiac function. The initial survey evaluates blood pressure, pulse, and skin perfusion. It is important to emphasize that effective resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock requires both restoration of intravascular volume and control of hemorrhage.

        "explanation": "Segmental arterial pressure determination by Doppler technique is a valuable adjunct to the physical examination of extremity vascular trauma. The presence of audible Doppler signals over an artery in the extremity does not rule out an arterial injury or indicate adequate perfusion. In the healthy and normovolemic person, the normal ankle-brachial index is 1:1. A ratio less than 0.9 or a 20-mm Hg difference between extremities should arouse the suspicion of significant arterial trauma. Doppler examination has not been widely used to screen for significant venous injuries and is of unproven value. The selective use of arteriography is fundamental to the evaluation of patients with suspected vascular trauma. The indications for arteriography generally have included a history of moderate hemorrhage at the penetrating injury site, injury in proximity to major arterial structures, diminished pulses, and peripheral nerve injury in the distribution of a nerve that is in proximity to a major vessel. Proximity as the sole indication for arteriography in the absence of diminished ankle-brachial ratio or other signs of major trauma, has proven to be an unreliable indicator of the need for arteriography. In the absence of classical signs of major vascular injury, patients with penetrating wounds in proximity to major vessels may be observed closely without arteriography. The use of arteriography can significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary exploration for suspected vascular trauma. If routine surgical exploration is performed whenever vascular injury is suspected, a negative exploration rate of about 60% or more can be expected. Selective use of arteriography reduces the negative exploration rate to about 35%. Arteriography is an extremely reliable method of excluding vascular trauma. In this context, the sensitivity is 97% to 100% and the specificity is 90% to 98%, with an overall accuracy between 92% and 98%.",

All patients with orthopedic injury, particularly those with fractures of the lower extremities or pelvis, are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis with sequential compression devices or low dose heparin has reduced the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in this group. Although concern for the use of heparin is appropriate, prospective studies demonstrate that low-dose heparin therapy can begin safely within 24 hours in 37% of patients and within 48 hours in 75%. Trauma patients who are paralyzed or immobilized by head injury, spine injury, or multiple orthopedic injuries should be considered for placement of a Greenfield filter. Fat embolism syndrome is a classic triad of acute respiratory failure; altered mental status, and petechiae of the head, torso and sclerae; and is frequently associated with long-bone and pelvic fractures. Less fulminant presentations, without petechiae and with lesser degrees of pulmonary dysfunction, are more common. At present, the only therapy for fat emboli syndrome is supportive care. Therefore, prevention is critical and numerous studies indicate that early fracture fixation decreases the incidence of this and other pulmonary complications. However, a subset of patients with femoral fractures and coexisting lung contusion has been recently found to have a higher incidence of ARDS if the fracture is repaired early than if repaired late.",

        ],
        "explanation": "Fractures to the axial spine, especially in the high cervical spine, can cause varying degrees of respiratory compromise. Patients with ventilatory failure from acute cord injury typically present with a paradoxical breathing pattern in which the abdomen protrudes on inhalation, creating a see-saw appearance. This is caused by paralysis of abdominal musculature and is seen with injuries as low as T-10 to T-11. Early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation must be considered, even in patients who appear compensated on initial evaluation. There is a strong tendency for such patients to tire and develop respiratory failure a few hours after the injury. In addition to ventilatory compromise, high axial spinal lesions can cause significant hypotension, confusing the initial evaluation of the patient. Most CNS control of arterial tone is mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. In high thoracic and cervical spinal cord injuries, these controlling pathways may be interrupted, with subsequent loss of vasomotor tone. This results in hypotension even without significant blood loss. Unlike hypovolemic shock, the patient’s extremities are warm and well perfused. A prospective, randomized trial has suggested that high doses of methylprednisolone given within 8 hours of injury have improved neurologic recovery. Starting treatment with steroids more than 8 hours after injury results in worse recovery than the placebo and is not recommended.",

        "explanation": "Local consequences of vascular injuries are generally related to acute arterial occlusion from thrombosis after injury. The results of ischemia distal to the injury sites may lead to limb or organ loss. The degree of tissue loss is related to the adequacy of collateral flow, the sensitivity of distal tissue to ischemia, and the delay involved in repairing the injury and restoring blood flow. With regard to these latter issues, the variability is great. The brain is more sensitive to ischemia because of high basal energy requirements in the absence of glycogen stores. Brain ischemia for longer than 4 minutes results in irreversible injury. The nerves and muscles are much more resilient, tolerating periods of ischemia up to 4 hours without permanent injury. An important principle of vascular repairs, however, is that the outcome is time-dependent, necessitating an aggressive approach and a high priority. The mechanism of injury from acute arterial ischemia includes both the initial anoxic phase when blood flow is ceased and reperfusion phase after restoration of blood flow. Termed the reperfusion injury, this phase includes the production of toxic metabolites and an inflammatory response which causes significant endothelial damage. The events associated with restoration of arterial blood flow after complete ischemia extend the magnitude and severity of the original insult in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves. If the severity of ischemia is significant enough to cause skeletal muscle necrosis, rhabdomyalysis with the release of potassium and myoglobin into the systemic circulation follows. Acute acidosis, hyperkalemia, and myoglobin-induced renal failure can occur.",

        "explanation": "The goal of operative management of vascular injuries is the rapid control of hemorrhage and the restoration of perfusion, with salvage of extremity or organ in jeopardy. In isolated-extremity vascular injury with arterial occlusion, systemic heparin should be administered to avoid propagation of thrombus in vessels distal to the occlusion. In multiple-injury patients, especially those with central nervous system trauma, heparin is inappropriate. The initial steps in the surgical management of vascular injuries is to obtain proximal and distal control of the injured vessel. This is most easily accomplished through uninjured areas adjacent to the injury using incisions normally employed for elective exposure of these vessels. Direct approach to the site of injury is fraught with the hazards of severe hemorrhage and iatrogenic trauma to the vessel itself or adjacent nerves. The management of the arterial injury is determined by the extent of injury. In a repair of more extensive arterial injuries, reversed saphenous vein from an uninjured lower extremity is the first choice for an interposition graft. The repair of concomitant venous injuries is a controversial injury. Proximal extremity veins and the great veins are repaired whenever technically possible to avoid the sequela of venous occlusion. Venous repair should not be attempted, in a hemodynamically unstable patient; rather, ligation should be performed to expedite the operation.",

        "correct": [
          "A",
          "D"
        ],
        "explanation": "Because of the retroperitoneal location of the duodenum and pancreas and the close proximity to a number of viscera and major structures, isolated penetrating injuries to the duodenum and pancreas are rare. Diagnosis of pancreaticoduodenal injuries depends on adequate exposure. A Kocher maneuver whereby the duodenum and head of the pancreas are mobilized from the retroperitoneal position by excising the lateral peritoneal reflection of the duodenum is essential for this exposure. Most penetrating injuries of the duodenum are simple lacerations that can be repaired primarily. Large injuries to the duodenum are more difficult to repair. Injuries of greater than 50% can lead to luminal compromise if repaired primarily. Treatment with a jejunal patch or duodenojejunostomy with a defunctionalized Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum can avoid the need for pancreaticoduodenectomy and its associated substantial mortality. Since many duodenal repairs are tenuous especially in combination with pancreatic injury and the concern about the digestive action of activated pancreatic enzymes on the repair, the technique of pyloric exclusion has been devised and is advocated by some. Pyloric exclusion involves suture or staple closure of the pylorus and restoration of gastrointestinal continuity by performing a gastrojejunostomy. Tube decompression of the duodenum should be performed in severe duodenal injuries but the biliary tract does not require decompression unless there has been an associated biliary tract injury. The management of pancreatic injuries depends on the location with respect to the head, body, and tail of the gland. Class III injuries of the head of the pancreas involve a relatively severe injury. In almost all situations, these injuries should simply be drained without attempts at resection or emergency internal drainage. If a patient develops a pancreatic fistula, the fistula can be controlled by the drain. If the fistula does not resolve with time, the pancreas can be drained internally at a later date.",

Intracranial pressure monitoring should be immediately initiated in any patient with cisternal compression and the intracranial hypertension should be vigorously treated. Intracerebral hemorrhage and cerebral contusion are common after trauma and are readily visualized on CT scan. Brain contusion appears as a focal, heterogeneous density with hemorrhage interspersed with injured tissue. Intracerebral hematomas are generally more homogeneous in their high density appearance. These lesions tend to “blossom” over time due to continued hemorrhage and the development of edema. Therefore, it is important to closely observe and monitor the ICP of such patients because a significant and hazardous mass effect may evolve, requiring surgical extirpation.

        ],
        "explanation": "The chest radiograph is by far the most important diagnostic study in patients with chest trauma and should be obtained early in all patients. Angiography is the best study to rule out major injury to the great vessels in the chest, and angiography remains mandatory in the majority of patients at risk for aortic disruption who have an abnormal chest radiograph. At the present time, CT scan of the chest appears to have a higher rate of missed injury than angiography for assessment of the aorta and should probably be avoided in patients with abnormal chest films. The majority of injuries to the chest can be successfully managed without surgical intervention. The routine use of a tube thoracostomy for treatment of hemothorax and pneumothorax is the cornerstone of therapy. Thoracotomy is most often needed for the control of massive bleeding, or bleeding which persists despite tube thoracostomy. About 80% to 85% of hemorrhages within the chest can be treated by tube thoracotomy alone. Even larger and deep lacerations of the lung parenchyma, which bleed with relatively low pressure from the pulmonary circulation, will be controlled by the reinflated lung parenchyma as well as edema in the tissue from the injury. Persistent bleeding is most commonly due to injuries to major proximal branches of the pulmonary circulation or injuries to systemic arteries including intercostal arteries and internal mammary arteries. The choice of position and surgical approach for thoracotomy for thoracic injury is dictated by the nature of the patient’s injuries, the certainty of diagnosis, and the potential for associated injuries involving other body sites. Although the standard postero-lateral thoracotomy provides optimal exposure to the contents of a particular hemithorax, the lateral position of the patient makes access to the other side of the chest or abdomen difficult if not impossible. Therefore, though postero-lateral thoracotomy provides the best access, it can be used only in patients who have injuries isolated to a given hemithorax. In most patients undergoing emergency thoracotomy for chest trauma, an antero-lateral approach must be used in patients supine to allow access to the abdomen and contralateral chest cavity. Although exposure through this incision is considerably more difficult, it is adequate with proper technique. Median sternotomy incision provides excellent exposure to the heart and the great vessels in the anterior mediastinum, but it provides very difficult exposure for repair of injuries to the lungs, descending aorta, chest wall, diaphragm, or esophagus. Therefore, like the postero-lateral thoracotomy, it can be used only when the patient’s injuries can be determined with relative certainty.",

        "explanation": "The anterior neck is divided into three zones defined by horizontal planes. Zone I represents the base of the neck and it invariably extends from the sternal notch to the top of the clavicles or the cricoid cartilage. Injuries here carry the highest mortality because of the risk of major vascular and intrathoracic injury. Zone II is the mid-body and largest portion of the neck. It extends from the top of Zone I to the angle of the mandible. Zone II injuries are most common but carry a lower mortality rate than either Zone I or Zone III injuries, since the injury is generally apparent and exposure of the vital structures is readily accomplished. Zone III is that part of the neck above the angle of the mandible. The risk of injury to the distal carotid artery, salivary glands and pharynx is greatest in this zone. Exposure in this region can be particularly difficult. Most surgical groups advocate exploration in the majority of penetrating neck wounds that penetrate the platysma in Zone II and in all patients with clinical signs of tracheal, esophageal, or major vascular injury. Preoperative angiography is generally not required for Zone II injuries because of the relative ease of exposure and control of critical vascular structures. Zone I and III penetrating injuries are selectively managed based on clinical presentation and the result of diagnostic studies. Hemodynamically unstable patients are immediately explored with operative incision based on the most likely source of vascular injury. Zone I injuries are essentially managed similar to mediastinal traversing wounds. Angiography is performed in all hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating wounds to Zone I to identify potential injuries to the thoracic outlet vessels or to plan better operative approach. Angiography is also performed for Zone III injuries, because of the possible inaccessibility of the internal carotid artery lesions or to demonstrate a need for systemic anticoagulation. Furthermore, most of the vascular lesions identified at the base of the skull are best managed by interventional angiography techniques.",

        "explanation": "Blood vessels are the most commonly injured structures in the neck. Major arterial injuries occur in 18% of penetrating neck wounds and major venous injuries in 26%. Blunt vascular injures account for a very small percentage of carotid injuries, however their management is somewhat controversial with treatment highly variable dependent upon the vascular lesion as well as concomitant injuries. When anatomically feasible, pseudoaneurysms are probably best managed by resection. The best treatment for arterial dissection, however, although not completely resolved, would appear to be systemic anticoagulation if possible to prevent propagation, embolization or thrombosis. Resection may not be required in the majority of patients. Penetrating carotid injury most commonly presents with exsanguinating hemorrhage. The indication for repair versus ligation of a carotid injury depends, in part, on the neurologic presentation. Patients without a neurologic deficit and a carotid injury should have restoration of vascular continuity with good neurologic outcome anticipated. Also, patients with all grades of neurological deficits short of coma should have primary vascular repair. Although experience with revascularization of patients suffering acute stroke from arteriosclerotic occlusive disease suggests that hemorrhagic infarction and death may result from revascularization, several reviews of acute revascularization in the trauma patient note that combined morbidity and mortality are significantly less in those patients repaired primarily compared to those managed with arterial ligation. Traumatic injury to the vertebral arteries are now more commonly identified due to the more liberal application of neck angiography. Unilateral vertebral artery occlusion seldom results in a neurologic deficit. Treatment of blunt vertebral artery injury with thrombosis generally is nonoperative: systemic anticoagulation is recommended to avoid further propagation of existing thrombus. The diagnosis of esophageal injury can be difficult. The sensitivity of esophography in detecting esophageal injuries varies from 50% to 90%; the sensitivity of endoscopy ranges from 29% to 100%. These modalities should be considered complimentary, and when combined have an accuracy of nearly 100%. Since virtually all reported deaths from cervical esophageal injuries are the result of delayed or misdiagnosis, a particularly high index of suspicion is warranted. When injured, the esophagus should be meticulously debrided and repaired primarily in one or two layers. It is important to drain all such wounds, because infection or salivary fistula is not an infrequent complication.",

          "A"
        ],
        "explanation": "Brain injury is the most common cause of death in trauma victims, accounting for about half of deaths at the accident site. The injuries are generally the result of blunt trauma, and motor vehicle accidents are the most frequent cause. Head injuries involve not only the primary injury but secondary injuries which can result from the events occurring after the primary insult, due to either the direct consequences of a process initiated by the primary injury or to deleterious outside influences. The occurrence and magnitude of secondary insults is often the determining factor in outcome from brain injury. Since secondary insults, in contrast to primary injuries, are amenable to medical therapy, they are the focus toward which the medical treatment of brain injury is directed. The primary external secondary injury processes occurring following brain injury are hypotension and hypoxia. Hypotension is the number one treatable determinant of severe head injury. A single episode of systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg occurring during the period from injury through resuscitation doubles the mortality and significantly increases the morbidity of any given brain injury. Intracranial hypertension may be considered as being deleterious via two somewhat separate mechanisms—herniation and ischemia. Herniation occurs when a pressure gradient exists across an incomplete barrier such as the tentorium or the falx cerebri. It is deleterious because of the tissue damage that results when herniation occurs. The second aspect of the intracranial hypertension that is deleterious is elevated resistance to cerebral blood flow, resulting in or exacerbating ischemia. Treatment of systemic hypertension is rarely indicated in the head injured patient. There is no evidence that hypertension promotes continued intracranial hemorrhage, and hypertension related to brain injury generally resolves when the intracranial hypertension is controlled. The treatment of intracranial hypertension involves elevating the head of the bed (reversed Trendelenburg position) but should only be performed after complete resuscitation has been accomplished. The confusion and agitation often attendant to head injury renders sedation desirable, therefore, patients with suspected head injury should generally be sedated. Pharmacologic relaxation, however, has the notable effect of limiting the neurologic examination to the pupils and, upon arrival to the hospital, the computed tomography scan. Therefore, its use in the absence of evidence of herniation should be limited to situations which sedation alone is not sufficient to optimize safe and efficient patient transport and resuscitation. When used, short acting agents are strongly preferred. Prophylactic administration of mannitol is not recommended due to volume depleting diuretic effect. In addition, although it is desirable to approximate the lower end of the normal range of PaCO2 during transport of a patient with suspected brain injury, the risk of exacerbating early ischemia by vigorous hyperventilation outweighs the questionable benefit in the patient without evidence of herniation. Therefore, ventilatory parameters consistent with optimal oxygenation and “normal” ventilation are recommended.",

        "explanation": "Penetrating trauma involves the transfer of energy to a relative small tissue area. The kinetic energy of a bullet disrupts and fragments cells and tissues, moving them away from the path of the bullet. The actual size of the frontal area of impact is determined by three factors—profile, tumble (spin and yaw), and fragmentation. A knife or jacketed bullet does not deform significantly during impact, whereas a hollow-point bullet flattens, spreads, and fragments on impact and therefore enlarges the area of injury. Low energy missiles including knives and other objects produce damage only by sharp cutting edges. Cavitation is minimal, and injury can be predicted simply by tracing the pathway of the weapon within the body. Low, medium and high velocity gunshot wounds, however, produce damage not only to tissue directly in the path of the missile but also produce cavitation injury to tissues in close proximity to the impact. The size of the cavitation injury is directly proportional to the bullet’s velocity. The essential difference between high velocity weapons and low and medium velocity weapons is that the higher velocity weapons have a much larger cavity or pressure cone than low-and medium-velocity missiles. The temporary cavity extends well beyond the actual bullet tract, producing a wider injury. The vacuum created by the cavitation pulls clothing, bacteria, and other debris from the surrounding areas into the wound, creating the additional risk of contamination.",

Specific indications for peritoneal lavage and blunt trauma include a number of conditions such as a patient with major noncontiguous injuries, a patient with suspected intraabdominal injury in whom physical examination is unreliable or impossible due to the need for prolonged general anesthesia for another injury. Peritoneal lavage is not useful for patients with abdominal gunshot wounds; all of these patients require immediate laparotomy.

Broadly speaking, the transition from a “safe zone” of hypothermia (where physiologic adaptations to heat loss are working) to a “danger zone” of hypothermia occurs between 33°C and 30°C. The cardiovascular response includes tachycardia followed by progressive bradycardia which starts at about 34°C , and which results in a 50% heart rate decrease at 28°C. Asystole occurs below 25°. Due to difficulty in palpating weak, bradycardic pulses in cold, stiff hypothermic patients, the presence of an organized rhythm should be taken as a sign of life that contraindicates CPR, despite the absence of a palpable pulse. Respiratory drive is increased during the early stages of hypothermia, but below 30°C progressive respiratory depression occurs, resulting in a decrease in minute ventilation. The neurologic response to hypothermia is heralded by progressive loss of lucidity and deep tendon reflexes, and eventually flaccid muscular tone. Pupillary dilatation and loss of cerebral autoregulation occur at temperatures below 26°, and electroencephalography becomes silent at 19–20°. It is important, however, to remember that patients have been revived with core temperatures as low as 17°C, and therefore the saying “No one is dead until warm and dead”.",

However, the means of diagnosis may affect this finding since small liver injuries, often detected only on CT scan of the abdomen, may go unreported while splenic injuries are likely to be clinically significant and require surgical intervention. Solid organs are most frequently injured from blunt trauma since the sudden application of pressure to the abdomen is more likely to rupture a solid organ than a hollow viscus, and this accounts for the greater incidence of solid organ injury. More elastic tissues of young people tolerate trauma better than those of older people, and this accounts, in part, for the differences in injuries between children and adults with blunt abdominal trauma.

        "explanation": "Post-traumatic intraabdominal infection is almost always the result of gastrointestinal tract contamination. Penetrating trauma accounts for the largest proportion of these infections. Because of the higher bacterial counts, the colon is consistently associated with a higher incidence of infectious complications than isolated gastric, duodenal, or small bowel injuries. The precise incidence of intraabdominal or incisional wound infection after colonic injuries depends on factors present at the time of injury (blood loss, degree of contamination, and other associated injuries) and on whether the wound is closed or left open. The use of perioperative antibiotics for trauma has been investigated extensively. Most studies have demonstrated that single-agent cephalosporins are at least as effective as multi-agent regimens in retarding intraabdominal abscess or wound infections resulting from a variety of contaminated traumatic wounds. Fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, the development of a paralytic ileus, increased fluid requirements, and failure to wean from a mechanical ventilation may all represent warning signs of the development of intraabdominal infection. CT is the single most useful diagnostic tool in this clinical setting because it yields considerable information with regard to organ injury in the presence of intraabdominal abscesses or fluid collections. Laparotomy, as a diagnostic tool for unexplained sepsis, has a low-yield in critically ill trauma patients and should not be used routinely.",

          "A"
        ],
        "explanation": "Solid abdominal organs such as the liver and spleen, are most commonly injured during blunt abdominal trauma. The management of splenic trauma has been the subject of major reexamination in the last few decades. Historically, splenic injuries are routinely treated with splenectomy. With increased appreciation of the danger of post-splenectomy sepsis, splenic salvage procedures and nonoperative management of these injuries have become well accepted. This is particularly true in children. The incidence of post-splenectomy sepsis varies from 0.5% to as much as 12% to 15%, depending on the age and underlying disease. The incidence is inversely related to age and is higher with underlying hematologic disorders such as lymphoma or thalassemia. The incidence of life-threatening sepsis in adult trauma patients is low, but higher than in the normal population. Splenic salvage should not be attempted if the patient has protracted hypotension or other severe injuries or if undue delays are encountered in an attempt to repair the spleen. Simple lacerations of the liver found at the time of surgery do not require drainage unless they are deep into the liver parenchyma, in which case they have a high probability of postoperative bile leakage. Biliary fistulas usually will close spontaneously, and major extrahepatic ductal injuries are rare. A T-tube placed in an otherwise normal common bile duct is inappropriate unless the extrahepatic biliary tree is injured. In the event that bleeding continues despite segmental ligation of parenchymal vessels, the structures of the porta hepatis should be compressed as a diagnostic maneuver (Pringle maneuver). If the bleeding stops, it is assumed to originate from the portal veins or hepatic artery. If the bleeding continues, it is presumed to arise principally from the hepatic veins or inferior vena cava.",

Therefore, after establishment of patent airway and adequate air exchange, the next priority is to support the circulation. The standard of care in the pre-hospital setting for hypotensive patients has been volume replacement and application of pneumatic anti-shock garment. In a recent large prospective randomized study, pneumatic anti-shock garments offered no survival advantage and actually increased mortality when used in patients with thoracic injuries. On the other hand, there was the suggestion that patients with a field blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg may benefit from this treatment. A second prospective study confirmed this result, indicating that the pneumatic anti-shock garment is of value to selected patients with field blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg. A recent clinical study has also demonstrated that internal hemorrhage from major vascular injuries should not be treated with intravenous fluid infusion until bleeding can be controlled in the operating room. In the hypotensive state, such major vascular injuries have a chance to clot and temporarily stop bleeding. But if intravenous volume restores blood pressure, the clot may dislodge and the rate of bleeding significantly increases. This may lead to both loss of oxygen carrying capacity and clotting factors, and ultimately exsanguination. Hypertonic saline restores intravascular volume and blood pressure to near normal very rapidly. The prospective randomized trial of normal saline versus hypertonic saline demonstrated a significant improvement in survival when the data were normalized to a select group of patients. There was no evidence that nontamponaded bleeding was exacerbated by the use of hypertonic saline despite the fact that blood pressure and intravascular volume increased.",

Widespread improvements in automobile safety have likely contributed to this change such that isolated sternal fractures may result from shoulder belt use and may not necessitate hospital admission in the stable patient. A flail chest occurs when consecutive ribs are fractured in more than one place, creating a free-floating segment of the chest wall. The creation of a free-floating segment may result in paradoxical chest wall motion with respiration. The intact chest wall expands during inspiration, but the negative intrathoracic pressure generated causes the flail segment to move inappropriately inward. Historically it was believed that the paradoxical motion was the cause of severe ventilatory insufficiency associated with the flail chest. Gradually, understanding of the pathophysiology of the flail chest has evolved. The ventilatory impairment is not simply due to paradoxical motion of the chest wall, but rather due to underlying pulmonary parenchymal injury in combination with the hypoventilation and splinting that results from the pain of multiple contiguous rib fractures. The open pneumothorax, or sucking chest wound, is an uncommon injury usually caused by impalement, high-speed motor vehicle accident, or shotgun blast, which causes a large chest wall defect. The diagnosis of a sucking chest wound can be made on simple inspection of the chest wall and hearing the flow of air through the wound. The defect should be occluded immediately with an impermeable dressing, essentially converting the situation to a closed pneumothorax. Tube thoracostomy is then performed to re-expand the lung. The chest wall defect usually requires operative debridement and formal chest wall closure. A hemothorax is the accumulation of blood in the pleural space and it occurs in 50–75% of patients with severe blunt or penetrating chest trauma. Massive hemothorax (i.e., larger than 1000–1500 ml) may require thoracotomy. Persistent bleeding, at a rate of > 200 ml/hour for four hours, or > 100 ml/hour for eight hours, is also an indication for thoracotomy. If the patient manifests any hemodynamic instability during the period of observation, urgent thoracotomy is mandatory.",

        "explanation": "With frontal impact, when the vehicle stops abruptly, unrestrained front-seat occupants move in one of two predictable pathways—down and under the dashboard or up and over the steering wheel. With the former movement, the knees strike the dashboard, and the upper legs absorb the primary energy transfer. Dislocated knees, fractured femurs, and posterior fracture dislocation of the hips are expected injuries. After the knees impact, the upper body flexes forward and up and over the steering wheel. The chest or abdomen impacts the steering wheel and the head impacts the wind shield. Predictable injury patterns following the up-and-over component of a frontal impact include the following: 1) anterior chest wall compression; 2) compression injuries to both hollow and solid abdominal viscera; 3) shear injuries such as lacerations to the aorta or liver, kidneys or other solid viscera; 4) injury to the brain from direct compression with scalp lacerations, skull fractures and cerebral contusions or from deceleration or shear forces; 5) acute neck flexion, hyperextension or both resulting in cervical spine injury. Three-point passenger restraints and air bags, although overall very effective in reducing injury, can cause specific related injuries. Common injuries when lap belts are incorrectly strapped above the anterior iliac spine include compression injuries of intraabdominal organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, small bowel, large bowel), increased intraabdominal pressure and diaphragmatic rupture.",

        "explanation": "Recent evidence suggests that frostbite injury may have two components: the initial freeze injury, and a reperfusion injury that occurs during rewarming. The initial response to tissue cooling is vasoconstriction and arterio-venous shunting, intermittently relieved by vasodilatation. With prolonged exposure, this response fails, and the temperature of the freezing tissues will approximate ambient temperature until -2°C. At this point, extracellular ice crystals form, and as these crystals enlarge, the osmotic pressure of the interstitium increases resulting in movement of intracellular water into the interstitium. Cells begin to shrink and become hyperosmolar, disrupting cellular enzyme function. During rewarming, red cell, platelet and leukocyte aggregation is known to occur and results in patchy thrombosis of the microcirculation. These accumulated blood elements are thought to release, among other products, the toxic oxygen-free radicals and the arachidonic acid metabolites which further aggravate vasoconstriction and platelet and leukocyte aggregation. Recent experimental evidence suggests that a substantial component of severe cold injury may be neutrophil-mediated in that a monoclonal antibody to neutrophil-endothelial and neutrophil-neutrophil adherence can markedly ameliorate the pathology of severe injury.",

        "explanation": "The treatment of frostbite with rewarming should begin in the Emergency Room and not in the field. Gradual, spontaneous warming is generally inadequate and delayed thawing, or rubbing the injured part in ice or snow often results in marked tissue loss. Rapid rewarming should be achieved by immersing the tissue in a large bath of 40–42°C. The water should feel warm, but not hot to the normal hand. The skin should be gently but meticulously cleansed, air dried, and affected area elevated to minimize edema. Infection develops in only about 13% of urban frostbite victims, but half of these infections are present at the time of admission. Therefore, most clinicians reserve antibiotics for identified infections. Following rewarming, the treatment goals are to prevent further injury while awaiting demarcation of the irreversible tissue destruction. The use of sympathetic blockade, surgical sympathectomy, and intraarterial vasodilating drugs has generally been ineffective. Heparin, thrombolytic agents, and hyperbaric oxygen have also failed to demonstrate any substantial treatment benefit. The difficulty in determining the depth of tissue injury and cold injury has led to a conservative approach to the care of frostbite injuries. As a general rule, amputation and surgical debridement are delayed for 2–3 months unless infection with sepsis intervenes. The natural history of full thickness frostbite is gradual demarcation of the injured area with dry gangrene and mummification clearly delineating a nonviable tissue.",

This pathology appears to be provoked by repeated exposure to cold but not freezing temperatures. Trenchfoot or cold emersion foot describes a non-freezing injury of the hands or feet, typically in sailors, fishermen, or soldiers resulting from chronic exposure to wet conditions and temperatures just above freezing. Frost nip is the mildest form of cold injury characterized by initial pain, pallor, and subsequent numbness of the affected body part. The injury is reversible and warming of the cold tissue results in return of sensation and function with no tissue loss. Frostbite is more severe and common form of cold injury and essentially describes local freezing of tissues. The mildest form (first degree injury) is associated with hyperemia and edema but without blistering. Second, third and fourth degree frostbite have progressive degrees of tissue injury and are noted by either characteristic clear blisters (second degree) or more hemorrhagic vesicles which are generally smaller than second degree blisters (third degree frostbite). In fourth degree frostbite, tissue necrosis, gangrene and full thickness tissue loss can be seen.",

        "correct": [
          "A",
          "B"
        ],
        "explanation": "Blunt injuries to the thoracic aorta occur in as many as 20% fatalities due to motor vehicle accidents. About half of these patients die at the scene. It is estimated that of the 50% who survive the initial injury, half will die within the first 24 hours and 90% will die within 10 weeks without surgical treatment. Blunt aortic disruption is associated with the mechanism of abrupt deceleration. Therefore, this mechanism of injury should lead to high index of suspicion. A chest radiograph is a useful screening procedure. Abnormal findings on chest film, or suspicion of the injury, must be aggressively investigated. Due to the very high morbidity of missed injuries, angiography is the diagnostic study of choice in patients at significant risk. Transesophageal echocardiography is a promising modality for the diagnosis of aortic injury, especially in patients who cannot be transported to the angiography suite. Early experience has shown transesophageal echo to be a very sensitive method, with very few missed injuries in experienced hands. Injuries to the aorta require surgical repair. The technique of aortic repair has been the subject of some controversy primarily due to the risk of spinal cord ischemia with cross clamping of the thoracic aorta. The complete use of cardiopulmonary bypass with full heparinization, however, has been shown to increase the mortality of patients who have other cerebral and vascular injuries, and is probably contraindicated in the blunt trauma patient. Most surgeons favor cross clamping of the aorta with expeditious repair of the injury. Rapid surgical repair is vital to survival of the patients. Preoperative management of patients with aortic disruption involves careful control of blood pressure and avoidance of hypertension. Pharmacologic control of blood pressure is indicated to avoid possible rupture before surgical repair. The use of sodium nitroprusside, however, should be avoided in patients with head injuries because the vasodilatory effect of this drug may cause an increase in intracranial pressure. A short-acting beta agonist such as esmolol or labetolol is probably the best choice if blood pressure control is needed.",

Basic life support skills such as suctioning, placement of oropharyngeal airways, the use of a bag mask device are usually sufficient at least to temporarily restore oxygenation at the injury site. On the other hand, approximately 10% of patients require endotracheal intubation and up to 20% would benefit from field intubation. Endotracheal intubation is the best procedure for airway control in patients who are in shock, have abnormal breathing patterns, or who are unable to protect their airways due to unconsciousness. Endotracheal intubation is far superior than that of bag valve mask systems because it provides larger total volumes and less risk of aspiration. Indications for endotracheal intubation in the field should include respiratory distress, hypovolemic shock, unconsciousness, significant head injury, and severe chest injury. Reported paramedic intubation success rates range between 90 and 98% in the literature, and complications are rare. On the other hand, there are problems with intubation at pre-hospital sites. Patients with head injuries may have C-spine injuries so in-line mobilization techniques are necessary to insure intubation without further injury to the cervical spine or cord. Patients often clench their teeth in which case either nasotracheal intubation or the use of paralytic agents such as succinylcholine may be necessary for successful intubation.",

A higher frequency of head injuries in children is partially explained by the proportionately greater head/body ratio, the thin skull, and the weaker supporting cervical musculature. In infants with unfused cranial sutures and open fontanels, intracranial hemorrhage can be perfuse and result in shock. The protuberant abdomen of the child obtains little protection from either the thoracic cage or pelvis, accounting for a higher incidence of intraabdominal injuries. The physiologic response to hypovolemia after pediatric trauma is characterized by the immediate constriction of small and medium-sized arteries, thus maintaining normal blood pressure. Decompensation generally occurs with a blood volume deficit of 20% to 25%. Tachycardia, tachypnea, diminished peripheral perfusion, and change in the level of consciousness are better potential indicators of early shock than blood pressure.

Evaluating the circulatory system following injury in the elderly, it must be remembered that elderly patients most likely are accustomed to a higher than normal blood pressure. Thus, while a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg is not alarming in a 25 year old, in a 75 year old, this may very well represent hypotensive shock if the “normal” pressure is 150 mm Hg systolic. Recent reports have suggested that pulmonary arterial catheters can be useful in the monitoring of patients with evidence of shock or hypoperfusion or history of intercurrent disease. In patients with a low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, volume replacement can be provided as needed, however, in the face of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, inotropic support may be of benefit. Lactated Ringer’s solution remains the resuscitation fluid of choice in the elderly patient. However, the initial experience with hypertonic solutions have been very favorable. Hypertonic fluids can reduce elevated blood pressures and improve cardiac performance with much smaller volumes when compared to isotonic solutions. Cerebral atrophy accompanies aging. In addition, the cerebral vasculature is fragile, particularly the veins. The combination of these factors make the elderly more prone to develop subdural hematomas, which may initially be subtle.",

        "explanation": "Many systems have been developed in an effort to allow comparison of trauma injuries and trauma patients among institutions. The impetus for injury severity scoring system is provided by the need to identify and classify severely injured patients in the pre-hospital phase, to predict mortality, to assess results, and to improve communication. The Revised Trauma Score has been the most widely applied as well as the most useful scoring system for the initial evaluation of trauma victims. It assumes that the physiologic parameters of blood pressure, respiratory rate, and head injury (assessed by the Glasgow Coma Score) can be used mathematically to assess injury severity and predict the most timely and sophisticated medical care. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), initially devised for blunt trauma and subsequently updated to include penetrating trauma, assesses the severity of nonfatal injuries determined in six different body areas. Thus, it is a specific anatomic index. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is calculated by assigning the AIS values to each injury in six body parts and then mathematically squaring the three most severely injured areas and adding the total. Unfortunately, this system does not adjust for patient age or patient-related comorbid risk factors. The Triss methodology is of great importance because it attempts to combine the trauma score, or physiologic component, and the ISS, or anatomic component. It also incorporates the patient’s age. The Triss method yields a specific probability of survival, and is recommended for use by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma to be used to maintain a trauma registry and quality assurance program.",

        "explanation": "The central issue in the operative management of colonic injuries is the controversy between primary repair of low-risk colonic injuries and repair or resection with exteriorization. Primary repair may be selected when additional risk factors have been excluded. Complications increase with primary repair when there is preoperative hypotension, intraperitoneal hemorrhage exceeding 1 liter, more than two additional organs injured, significant fecal spillage, or when more than six hours have elapsed since injury. Many patients with low-risk penetrating colon injuries can be treated with primary closure in the absence of these risk factors. High-risk colon injuries are those associated with severe injuries, as indicated above, and should be treated with resection and colostomy. Rectal injuries should be suspected when there is any penetrating injury or a significant pelvic fracture. Sigmoidoscopic examination is essential. The principles of operative management include wide debridement of all dead and devitalized tissue and repair of rectal wall when possible. A totally defunctioning colostomy (not a simple loop colostomy) is necessary. Retrorectal drainage is indicated only in selected severe injuries. The distal stump should be washed out to evacuate the fecal contents. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, nutritional support, and serial debridements are also indicated.",

          "E"
        ],
        "explanation": "Renal injuries constitute the greatest proportion of genitourinary tract trauma. The presence of hematuria remains the most sensitive clinical indicator of renal trauma. The specificity of hematuria is low, however, and the practice of performing an IVP in all patients with blunt trauma and microscopic hematuria is both time-consuming and unnecessary. In several studies examining clinical features associated with significant renal trauma, three factors have been identified—shock, gross hematuria, and major associated injuries. The incidence of renal trauma requiring operation in the absence of any of these factors was 0 in several series. The indications for radiographic assessment of renal injury in the face of penetrating trauma should be far more liberal, since there are conflicting reports on the degree of correlation between the injury’s severity and the degree of hematuria. Radiographic studies for the diagnosis of renal trauma include single-or multiple-film IVP, formal nephrotomography, and CT scan. Single-film (“one-shot”) IVP is useful primarily for documenting the presence of two functioning kidneys and has limited use as a screening examination for renal trauma. CT scan, however, has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for most renal trauma. Renal injuries can be staged with respect to those likely to require an operation or to develop complications. CT scan also allows more precise assessment of the degree of perinephric hemorrhage and the degree of collecting system disruption than operative inspection. A number of major renal injuries are diagnosed at the time of laparotomy. Most commonly, a perinephric hematoma is encountered in association with blunt hepatic or splenic trauma. Indications for renal exploration at laparotomy following blunt trauma include an expanding or pulsatile perinephric hematoma or suspected renal vascular injury. In a patient with blunt injuries, it is preferable to defer exploration of nonexpanding, nonpulsatile perinephric hematomas to complete treatment of intraabdominal and other associated life-threatening injuries. Postoperative CT scan may be useful for formal staging of these injuries. A perinephric hematoma that is found during laparotomy for penetrating trauma should generally be explored carefully. Unlike blunt injuries, continued or recurrent hemorrhage is more often a problem. Most bladder injuries (over 95%) occur in association with pelvic fractures. Bladder ruptures are classified into those that rupture into the free peritoneal cavity and those with extravasation limited to the retroperitoneum. Intraperitoneal bladder ruptures are characteristically large and require early operative repair. Extraperitoneal bladder ruptures in most cases, however, can be treated nonoperatively using simple urethral catheter drainage alone.",

In general, however, peritoneal lavage has a limited role in the care of pediatric patients as it provides confirmation of a finding, hemoperitoneum, that does not mandate operation. Unlike adults, 95% of pediatric trauma patients are hemodynamically stable on admission. The single most useful diagnostic maneuver is a CT scan, which delineates solid visceral injuries with a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity. The spleen and liver are injured with about equal frequency in children sustaining blunt trauma, and together these two target organs account for about 75% of childhood abdominal injuries. Experience at virtually every major children’s trauma center in the world supports the safety and efficacy of nonoperative management of children with splenic ruptures. Most series report splenic salvage in 90% to 100% of children. Although therapy must be individualized, the general guidelines are that operation is not indicated until there is refractory hypotension or a transfusion requirement in excess of 50% of blood volume in the first 24 hours. In reality, few patients approach this, and transfusion practices are such that only 10% to 20% of patients with isolated splenic injuries require blood transfusion at all. The management of liver injuries in pediatric patients has also changed since the advent of routine abdominal CT scan for blunt trauma. Several reports describe successful nonoperative treatment of liver injuries detected radiologically in children. This approach is applicable in most children, with a success rate of 90% and transfusion requirements similar to those patients with ruptured spleens.",

        "explanation": "The spectrum of pelvic fracture injuries range from minor isolated non-displaced fractures of the pubic rami to severe injuries with multiple fractures that can be rapidly lethal. Unlike most long bone fractures, only 25% of pelvic fractures are apparent on physical examination. Hemorrhage caused by laceration of the sacral venous plexus, multiple arterial branches of the hypogastric vessels, or bleeding from fractured cancellous bone presents a formidable challenge to the trauma surgeon. Massive hemorrhage is the principle cause of early death in patients with pelvic fracture, and survival depends principally on rapid identification and control. The presence of hemorrhage from associated intraperitoneal injuries should be considered first, therefore diagnostic peritoneal lavage is indicated for most patients with pelvic fractures. A supraumbilical lavage is preferable under these circumstances because the possibility of catheter penetration of a large retroperitoneal hematoma dissecting into the preperitoneal space. Peritoneal lavage performed incorrectly in the infraumbilical site with a major pelvic fracture may yield an incidence of false-positive results as high as 45%. When performed properly in the supraumbilical position, false-positive lavage rates have been reported to be as low as 1%. If laparotomy is indicated once a thorough abdominal exploration is performed and injury is repaired, the size of the pelvic hematoma may be assessed. If a rapidly expanding pelvic hematoma is seen, rapid closure of the abdominal wound is indicated followed immediately by pelvic angiography and embolization of active arterial bleeding. In selected patients with unstable fractures involving the sacrum or pubic diastasis injuries, the application of pelvic external fixation may reduce hemorrhage from cancellous bone and sacral venous plexus. In many centers, pelvic fixation is preferred to arteriography and embolization for the initial control of bleeding. A urethral tear should be suspected in any male with a pelvic fracture. These patients should be examined carefully for signs of urethral injury including scrotal or perineal hematoma, blood at the urethral meatus, or anterior displacement of the prostate gland on rectal examination. The presence of any of these clinical findings constitutes a contraindication to immediate placement of a urethral catheter. A retrograde urethrogram should be obtained in these cases by the placement of a small balloon catheter in the fossa navicularis and gravity infusion of 10–15 ml of contrast medium.",

In the supine position, there are no measurable changes in heart or respiratory rates, blood pressure or pulse pressure. Class II hemorrhage involves loss of 15% to 30% of volume loss. Clinical signs include tachycardia and tachypnea. The systolic blood pressure may be only slightly decreased, especially in the supine position, but the pulse pressure is narrowed. Patients with Class II hemorrhage can generally be resuscitated with crystalloid solutions but some may require blood transfusions. With Class III hemorrhage, 30% to 40% of total body volume is lost. Patients with Class III hemorrhage present with obviously inadequate perfusion; marked tachycardia and tachypnea, cool, clammy extremities with significant delayed capillary refill; hypotension; and significant changes in mental status. Class III hemorrhage represents the smallest volume of blood loss that consistently produces a decrease in systolic blood pressure. The resuscitation of these patients requires blood transfusion in addition to crystalloid administration. Class IV hemorrhage involves loss of greater than 40% of blood volume. This represents life-threatening hemorrhage. These patients require immediate transfusion for resuscitation and frequently require immediate surgical intervention.",

        "explanation": "Injuries to the heart resulting in cardiac tamponade can occur from either blunt or penetrating trauma, though penetrating injuries are much more common. Pericardial tamponade occurring after blunt trauma usually results from rupture of a chamber of the heart, with many associated with death at the scene. Penetrating trauma is the usual cause of pericardial tamponade and the outcome is directly related to the character of the weapon. Reported survival rates for small injuries to a single chamber are between 60 and 87%, although patients who arrive moribund do poorly regardless of care. The diagnosis of pericardial tamponade should be considered in any patient with penetrating chest trauma, particularly to the central portion of the chest. The classic Beck’s triad, consisting of muffled heart sounds, decreased pulse pressure, and jugular venous distention, occurs in only the minority of patients. The diagnosis of pericardial tamponade can be somewhat difficult but should be suspected in patients with trauma who remain hypotensive and have no evidence of external blood loss or hemorrhage into the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis. Unfortunately, CVP measurements are neither sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade, and are dependent upon the patient’s volume status and the level of agitation. Two-dimensional echocardiography is very sensitive to the presence of pericardial fluid and wall motion abnormalities. If available in a timely fashion, cardiac echo is a very good diagnostic test to rule out cardiac tamponade in a stable patient.

In this patient that would be 9.6 to 19.2 liters of lactated Ringer's solution. The early elevation of circulating levels of catecholamines and glucocorticoids following burn injury induces glycogenolysis, which results in elevated circulating blood glucose levels. Glucose should not be administered in the resuscitation fluids, since the resulting exaggeration of hyperglycemia could induce osmotic diuresis. In the first 24 hours colloid-containing solution is not commonly used, but if it is used even the Evans formula recommends only 1 ml. per kg. body weight per percent of body surface burned. Moreover, patients in one study who received colloid-containing fluids continued to gain weight during the first 3 postinjury days, retained more sodium, and had less urine output than patients who received only crystalloid fluids in the first 24 hours. Hypertonic salt solution is also not commonly used for burn patient resuscitation because of the recently described and surprisingly frequent occurrence of acute renal failure and increased mortality associated with its use. If hypertonic salt is used, the amount infused should be less than 9 liters, to avoid excessive elevation of the serum sodium concentration (i.e., above 160 mEq. per liter).

Clinical signs are nonspecific and may be delayed. Chest x-rays are also unreliable in detecting even severe inhalation injury. Chest x-rays taken within 24 hours of injury were found to be falsely negative in 92% of 106 patients with inhalation injury. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination is the most reliable single means of diagnosing inhalation injury of the large airways, but in patients who inhaled finely particulate smoke the large airways may show little if any inflammatory change. The distance smoke particles travel before deposition in the airways is inversely related to particle size. When the smoke particle mass median diameter is less than 0.5 mm., deposition occurs in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. In such patients, inhalation injury is best identified by prolonged retention of xenon 133 as assessed by a ventilation perfusion lung scan. Historically, fluid restriction was recommended for patients with inhalation injury, but in recent years it has become obvious that such patients typically require more resuscitation fluid than the volume estimated by commonly used formulas. Edema of the small airways and occlusion due to endobronchial sloughing and inspissation predispose burn patients to develop pneumonia. In one study, 46% of burn patients with inhalation injury developed pneumonia and 69% of the pneumonias occurred in the first postburn week. The comorbid effect of moderate to severe inhalation injury is related to both age and burn size and increases mortality by a maximum of 20% above that predicted on the basis of age and burn size in patients whose burn injury alone would be associated with a 75% likelihood of death. In patients with only mild inhalation injury there is little if any increase in mortality above that predicted on the basis of age and burn size alone. Prophylactic use of high-frequency percussive ventilation minimizes airway collapse and atelectatic changes, as a consequence of which the incidence of pneumonia is reduced and survival is significantly increased.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The goal of burn patient resuscitation is the maintenance of vital organ function at the least immediate or delayed physiologic cost. Fluid resuscitation of burn patients does not need to be a test of maximum renal function. Adequacy of volume replacement and of renal blood flow are indicated by an hourly urine output of 30 to 50 ml. in adults and 1 ml. per kg. per hr. in children weighing less than 30 kg. In patients with extensive muscle damage caused by high-voltage electric injury, heavy loads of hemochromagens give the urine the appearance of port wine. Such patients are prone to develop acute renal failure unless brisk urine output is maintained until the pigment concentration is reduced to insignificant levels. Fluid should be infused into such patients at the rate needed to achieve an hourly urine output of 75 to 100 ml., but if the patient does not respond to increased fluid input with an increase in urine volume and clearing of the heme pigments, a diuretic should be given. A pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 17 to 20 mm. Hg is indicative of an adequate circulating blood volume, but a urinary sodium concentration of less than 20 mEq. per liter is consistent with an intravascular volume deficit.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: At the end of the first 48 hours of resuscitation, when lactated Ringer's solution is used in the first 24 hours and colloid-containing fluid and electrolyte-free fluid in the second 24 hours, modest hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration of 128 to 130 mEq. per liter) is commonly observed but requires no treatment. The total body salt load is actually increased, and appropriate fluid management permits the increased evaporative water loss to correct that imbalance. The most common postresuscitation fluid and electrolyte disturbance is hypernatremia associated with dehydration due to inadequate replacement of insensible water loss. The hourly insensible water loss, which far exceeds maintenance fluid requirements in uninjured patients, can be calculated thus: Insensible water loss (in ml./hr.)=(25 + % of body surface burned) × total body surface area (sq. m.) The release of potassium from red cells and other tissues injured by the burn or by electrical current can cause usually modest hyperkalemia. If acidosis occurs, the hyperkalemia may be exaggerated to symptomatic levels that require treatment. Hypokalemia can be induced following resuscitation by the kaliuretic effect of sulfamylon burn cream, but the hypokalemia associated with 0.5% silver nitrate soak treatment is due to transeschar leaching of potassium. Hypocalcemia is frequently associated with hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of hemodilution by the resuscitation fluid and the cytokine-induced reprogramming of hepatic protein synthesis. In such cases ionized calcium levels are commonly normal.",

The appearance of focal areas of dark red or dark brown discoloration are the most common changes indicative of burn wound infection, but similar changes may be caused by hemorrhage due to local trauma or maceration. Accelerated separation of the eschar is often produced by burn wound infections, but delayed separation of the eschar is indicative of effective control of the microbial population in the burn wound. Conversion of an area of partial-thickness burn to full-thickness necrosis is the most reliable clinical sign of invasive burn wound infection. Identification of such a change mandates histologic examination of a burn wound biopsy, which is the only reliable means of differentiating the colonization of nonviable tissue from the invasion of viable tissue. Identification of micro-organisms in the unburned viable tissue of a burn wound biopsy confirms the diagnosis of invasive burn wound infection. Microbial migration along the skin appendages, terminal nerve radicles, and thrombosed capillaries in the eschar and heavy growth of micro-organisms in the subeschar space are manifestations of the colonization of nonviable tissue and represent the mechanisms by which eschar separation occurs.",

When the diagnosis of invasive Pseudomonas burn wound infection has been made, one half of the daily dose of a broad-spectrum penicillin, typically piperacillin, suspended in 1 liter of normal saline, should be infused into the subeschar tissues beneath the infected wound. A number 20 spinal needle should be used for the infusion, to minimize the number of injection sites. Following a second subeschar infusion of the broad-spectrum penicillin just prior to operation, the infected tissue should be excised. The excised wounds should not be autografted but covered with a biologic dressing or a dressing soaked with an antimicrobial solution such as 5% mafenide acetate. The patient is returned to the operating room in 24 to 48 hours to examine the excised wound and assess the adequacy of the débridement. The frequency of perilymphatic and perivascular proliferation of invading Pseudomonas organisms is associated with a risk of metastatic spread to remote organs or tissues. Consequently, systemic antimicrobial therapy should be instituted based on the sensitivity patterns of the resident microbial flora and adjusted as necessary on the basis of the patient's culture and sensitivity results. Amputation is frequently necessary to control invasive burn wound infection when a phycomycotic infection on a limb has traversed the investing fascia and involves significant amounts of the subfascial tissue.",

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be initiated at the site of injury if cardiac arrest is present. Cardiac arrhythmias may also occur following resuscitation, necessitating electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring for at least 48 hours following injury in patients with a history of loss of consciousness or an abnormal ECG. Tissue damage and tissue destruction beneath the investing fascia can result in the formation of edema that increases muscle compartment pressure to a level that necessitates fasciotomy (> 30 mm. Hg). The current flow in a limb in contact with high-voltage current can be so great as to damage even the periosseous muscles and make amputation necessary. Liberation of hemochromogens as a consequence of deep tissue injury is associated with an increased incidence of acute renal failure necessitating hemodialysis. Electric injury does not influence the need for monitoring by pulse oximetry, and in fact the destruction of deep tissue in a limb may preclude application of the pulse oximeter to that extremity.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: An eye injured by a strong chemical agent must be irrigated immediately at the site of the accident to minimize corneal damage. Prolonged irrigation for 12 to 72 hours is recommended for eyes injured by a strong alkali solution. Irrigation is difficult because of blepharospasm unless a modified scleral contact lens with an irrigating sidearm is used. Emetics should be avoided in the early treatment of patients following chemical ingestion since additional injury of the esophagus, oropharynx, and upper airway may be caused as the chemical is regurgitated. The intra-arterial infusion of calcium gluconate has been reported to limit tissue damage and relieve pain, but local excision of the involved tissue may be necessary for definitive control of pain and removal of the injured tissue. Even though phenol is only slightly soluble in water, initial water lavage of burns caused by phenol should be carried out. Following that initial lavage, the involved area should be washed with a lipophilic solvent such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or glycerol to remove the residual phenol. A dilute 0.5% to 1% solution of copper sulfate can be used as a wash to facilitate identification and impede the ignition of embedded phosphorus particles. If excessive amounts of copper sulfate are absorbed through the injured tissues, intravascular hemolysis can occur and may cause renal failure. Consequently, one should avoid the use of more concentrated solutions of copper sulfate and should never apply the copper sulfate solution as a soak. The important principle of treatment is to prevent ignition of the particles by preventing their exposure to air, and that can be done most safely by applying an occlusive dressing soaked with saline or water.",

Blocking evaporative water loss by application of an impermeable membrane is not attended by a consistent diminution in metabolic rate, indicating that the burn patient is not externally cold but is internally warm. The hypermetabolism in burn patients is temperature sensitive but not temperature dependent. Even though earlier measurements described a curvilinear relationship between metabolic rate and extent of burn, recent measurements have shown that metabolic rate increases in linear fashion and rises to levels of twice normal in patients with burns of 75% and more of the total body surface. Lipid stores are the major source of metabolic fuel that is oxidized for energy, and not lean body mass, which undergoes proteolysis to provide the amino acids necessary for protein synthesis and wound healing as well as gluconeogenic processes that provide fuel for tissues requiring glucose. Blood flow to a burned limb is markedly increased as compared with flow in an unburned limb of the same patient, and the flow increase is directed to the wound per se, not the underlying muscles.",

This is fortunate, because it is difficult to achieve a favorable result with primary excision and grafting of the central face. Management of the burned hand is dictated by the depth of injury. Superficial burns are managed with elevation, topical antimicrobials, and full passive range of motion for each joint twice daily. Deep, partial and full-thickness injuries are best managed by excision and sheet grafting as soon as practical. Hands are immobilized in a functional position for seven days after surgery before passive and active therapy is resumed. Fourth degree hand burns, which involve the underlying extensor mechanism, joint capsules or bone are significantly more difficult management problems and are managed by staged sheet autografting and often benefit from temporary axial Kirschner wire fixation of open and unstable interphalangeal or metacarpophalangeal joints. Burns of the external ear are treated with twice daily cleansing and application of mafenide acetate. Deep burns of the external ear are commonly complicated by acute suppurative chondritis if topical mafenide acetate is not applied. In general, the practice for deep genital burns is to manage these limited surface area injuries with topical therapy for a period of two to three weeks unless the wounds are remarkably deep.

The magnitude of this response peaks in those with injuries of 60% or more of the body surface at as high as twice the normal basal metabolic rate. The etiology of the hypermetabolic response is not entirely understood but is assumed to involve a combination of factors including a change in hypothalamic function with coincident increases in glucagon, cortisol and catecholamine secretion, deficient gastrointestinal barrier function with translocation of bacteria and their byproducts, bacterial contamination of the burn wound with systemic release of similar products from this source, and some element of enhanced heat loss via transeschar evaporation of fluid.

However, these injuries routinely demonstrate the following: 1) upper airway obstruction secondary to progressive edema; 2) reactive bronchospasm from aerosolized irritants; 3) small airway occlusion initially from edema and subsequently from sloughed endotracheal debris and loss of ciliary clearance mechanisms; 4) microatelectasis from the loss of surfactant and alveolar edema; and 5) interstitial and alveolar edema secondary to loss of capillary integrity. The physiologic consequences of these aberrations are upper and lower airway obstruction, increased airway resistance, decreased compliance, and an increase in the dead space to tidal volume ratio and intrapulmonary shunting. Upper airway obstruction is best managed with prompt endotracheal intubation which is maintained for 48 to 72 hours and elevation the head. In equivocal cases, bronchoscopy is performed and patients with significant airway edema are intubated using the bronchoscope as a stylet. Although severe steam inhalation can result in direct heat injury to the distal tracheobronchial tree, more distal airway injuries are usually caused by aerosolized toxins rather than thermal injury, as the upper airway is a highly effective heat sink. Although moderate inflating pressures will help expand recruitable segments, peak inspiratory pressures in excess of 40 cm H2O should be avoided because they are associated with both overt barotrauma as well as more subtle overpressure injuries to the pulmonary microvasculature and alveoli which themselves exacerbate respiratory failure. High inflating pressures are also ineffective in recruiting additional lung, because the compliance decrements are not homogeneous and high pressures simply over distended more compliant segments.",

        "explanation": "The large number of fluid resuscitation formulae in common use is attributed to the fact that no formula accurately predicts fluid requirements in every patient. No formula can replace a physician at the bedside repeatedly evaluating the patient’s physiology through the resuscitative period. A reasonable consensus formula is the Modified Brooke formula, however, regardless of the formula chosen to initiate resuscitation, subsequent fluid administration is best guided by regular assessment of the resuscitation end points, rather than prediction of any formula. Vasoactive mediators released from the injured tissue result in diffuse capillary leaks seen shortly after major burn injury with resulting extravasation of both crystalloid and colloid for the first 18 to 24 hours after burn. The pathophysiology explains the enormous volume requirements seen in such patients and is the reason that most resuscitative formulae withhold colloid until 24 hours post-injury. Children have been found to commonly require fluid in excess of that predicted by several formulae. These requirements are generated if one uses a urine output of 1–2 cc/kg/hour as a resuscitation end point. These needs are real in infants and very young children whose renal concentrating abilities are not completely mature. However, in toddlers and older children whose concentrating abilities are more mature, targeting urine flow of 0.5–1 cc/kg/hour results in overall fluid requirements closer to that of an adult and less overall edema. Patients with inhalation injury have demonstrated to have overall volume requirements greater than that predicted by standard formulae, possibly secondary to release of vasoactive mediators from injured burned parenchyma. During the first 24 hours, Ringer’s lactate is the primary resuscitative fluid. Because children less than 10 kg can develop hypoglycemia if glucose is not administered, Ringer’s lactate or half normal saline with 5% dextrose at a maintenance rate is given along with the reduced amount of Ringer’s lactate. Dextrose containing fluids should not be given as a primary resuscitative fluid in adults, as hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis will result.",

        "explanation": "A common argument against the policy of early burn wound excision is the prodigious blood loss which has been associated with these procedures. However, modern blood conserving practices as well as earlier excision of wounds have diminished this concern. Tangential excision of the torso, neck and head are done after subeschar injection of dilute epinephrine solutions. Tangential excisions of the extremities are done after exsanguination and inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet. Once necrotic eschar is excised to a bed of viable tissue, immediate biologic closure is mandatory. Ideally, immediate autografting is performed. When donor sites are insufficient for this purpose, a temporary biologic cover must be chosen while awaiting healing of donor sites for further use. Such covers should prevent desiccation and provide a vapor and bacterial barrier over the excised wound. Fresh or cryopreserved human allograft is most appropriate for this use. Once placed on a viable wound bed, it will vascularize and provide physiologic wound closure until rejected 2 to 4 weeks later at which time or before, it is replaced with reharvested autograft. A second common use for biologic dressings is a physiologic cover for selected clean superficial wounds as they epithelialize, which minimizes the pain associated with open partial thickness burns. Allograft, screened for malignant and infectious diseases, a precarious resource, is however, not commonly used as a biologic dressing in these circumstances. For this purpose, reconstituted porcine xenograft should be used.",

The increasing popularity of early excision is based upon several documented and perceived advantages over the traditional approach of allowing eschar to be liquefied by bacterial proteases until separation occurs, leaving a bed of granulation tissue which is subsequently autografted. Documented advantages include improved survival in patients with injuries involving more than 30–40% of the body surface, truncated hospital stays, lowered cost, and fewer painful dressing changes. Although not proven, conventional wisdom suggests that a decrease in the duration and intensity of the hypermetabolic response, improved immunologic function and less hypertrophic scarring result from early excision.",

Fire victims who are well ventilated with high concentrations of oxygen by emergency response personnel from the time of extrication commonly have normal carboxyhemoglobin values (< 5%) on initial evaluation despite significant exposure to carbon monoxide at the time of injury. Carboxyhemoglobin is not sensed by standard transmission pulse oximetry, so a normal oxygen saturation on such a monitor does not preclude the possibility of significant carboxy-hemoglobinemia. Hydrogen cyanide, which is commonly present in the smoke of structural fires, interferes with oxidative metabolism at the cellular level resulting in lactic acidosis.

Many burn patients have sustained concurrent injuries and the initial evaluation should therefore be approached as any multiple trauma patient. After evaluating and securing the airway, while maintaining control of the cervical spine, breathing mechanics are assessed, a rough estimate is made of circulating volume, the level of consciousness is documented, and the patient is completely exposed. This should be done in a warm environment to avoid hypothermia. The burn specific secondary survey includes a complete history, vital signs, a detailed physical examination and laboratory and radiologic studies appropriate for the mechanism of injury. The patient’s neurologic status should be carefully documented early during the evaluation, because many patients will become progressively obtunded secondary to the administration of analgesics and sedatives and from intravascular volume depletion. The corneal epithelium and globes should be examined prior to the development of adnexal edema which will render adequate examination more difficult. Major corneal epithelial burns are obvious by the opaque appearance that results. More subtle defects are apparent only after staining with topical fluorescein. Upper airway injuries are suspected by the presence of a hoarse voice, burns to the lips or tongue, singed facial hair and nasal vibrissae, or carbonaceous sputum.

Pulsatile doppler signals in the lower pressure distal vasculature, such as the plantar arch and digital vessels, should be documented hourly. The loss of pulsatile doppler signals is consistent with an increase in tissue pressure if intravascular volume is adequate. Although lesser voltages may cause local destructive injuries without systemic sequelae, patients exposed to higher voltage (> 1000 volts), present with a combination of deep tissue injuries secondary to the passage of current, locally destructive entrance and exit wounds, and other local and systemic effects.

The surgical importance of this phenomenon is that operations involving the region of the renal arteries may sacrifice the internal spermatic artery. If the two other arteries are intact, the testes will survive; however, if the patient has had a vasectomy and the artery of the vas has been sacrificed, there is a possibility of testicular atrophy, since the testicle will have to be totally dependent on the arterial supply derived from the small external spermatic artery.",

Transscrotal manipulations, whether they be percutaneous or open, are to be condemned because of the possibility of tumor spillage with the ultimate necessity for hemiscrotectomy to control local recurrence. Certainly, repeated examinations over a very short period of time are appropriate, but no time should be lost if there is true suspicion of a testicular tumor. Before the high inguinal exploration it is helpful to obtain serum levels of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein, which are important tumor markers.

About 15% of couples in the United States are affected, and in about 25%-50% of infertility cases, the male contributes to the problem. The cornerstone of male fertility evaluation is the semen analysis. Oligospermia, or a low sperm count, is an incomplete form of testicular failure due to a number of causes. A varicocele is found in about 15% of the general male population, but 40% of infertile men have this finding. Men with a varicocele can exhibit low sperm counts but more often have diminished sperm motility and abnormal morphology. Surgical ligation or angiographic embolization of the internal spermatic vein improves the semen parameters in 50%-70% of these men and gives subsequent pregnancy rates of 25%-50%. Complete testicular failure is diagnosed by a testis biopsy showing no sperm production or by a markedly elevated serum FSH level, indicating the absence of negative feedback inhibition induced by spermatogenesis. Complete testicular failure is not remedial by treatment. Anti-sperm antibodies are found frequently in infertile men and represent an important cause of infertility.

        "explanation": "The treatment of prostatic cancer depends on whether the disease is localized to the prostate or advanced beyond the gland. Because prostate cancer advances slowly, the morbidity of therapy may exceed the therapeutic benefit in the elderly and debilitated. Patients who have a limited life expectancy and low stage disease are frequently treated with observation only. If the tumor is confined within the prostatic capsule (Stage A or B), options include radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and radioactive implants. Radical prostatectomy is usually carried out through the retropubic approach. Through this approach a node dissection can be done for further staging, and the procedure abandoned if the nodes contain tumor. In patients with a high index of suspicion for positive nodes, a laparoscopic pelvic node dissection can be performed to decrease postoperative morbidity. The use of the nerve-sparing prostatectomy can be used to preserve penile erection in those patients who are potent. In this approach, the nerves concerned with penile erection are excluded from the dissection. The incidence of impotence following traditional radical prostatectomy is l00% but can be cut in half with the nerve-sparing approach. Hormonal ablation is the initial treatment of choice for advanced prostatic cancer. Most prostatic cancers are androgen-responsive. Androgen ablation will cause improvement in 80-90% of patients with regression of tumor in about 40%. The testis is the primary source of androgen and orchiectomy remains the gold standard and treatment of choice for advanced prostatic cancer. Estrogen will produce castrate levels of testosterone, but the side effects of fluid retention and increased incidence of thromboembolic diseases such as heart attacks and strokes make this hormone a poor choice in this high risk age group.",

        "explanation": "The introduction of ESWL has virtually eliminated open surgery for renal and ureteral lithiasis. The basic principles of all lithotriptors include shock wave generation, focusing of the sound wave, and imaging of the stone. All lithotriptors produce shock waves by a spark gap electrode or by a piezoelectric or electromagnetic element. The wave is then focused towards the stone which is localized either employing fluoroscopy or ultrasonography. The patients are either submersed in a water bath or “coupled” by a water cushion. The acoustic density of water and body tissues is essentially the same. Therefore, there is little or no impedance of the shock wave at the water-body interface. Upon striking the stone, which is of different acoustical density, the shock wave undergoes reflection and refraction, resulting in compressive and tensile forces which fragment the stone. Complications of ESWL are rare. The most common complication after ESWL is ureteral obstruction secondary to stone fragments requiring either additional ESWL, urethroscopic stone retrieval or stent placement. ESWL is the treatment choice for the vast majority of renal and proximal ureteral stones with stone-free rates ranging from 60%–95% at six months. Stones larger than 3 cm and branch stones such as staghorn calculi are best treated with percutaneous nephrolithotripsy alone or in combination with ESWL. The combination of extracorporeal and percutaneous techniques can result in average dome clearance rates in excess of 80%.",

Cystoscopy is not only diagnostic but also therapeutic because superficial tumors are easily excised or fulgurated through endoscopic instruments. Approximately 70% of patients with bladder cancer will present with local disease. This is associated with five year adjusted survival rate of 88%. Close vigilance is important because the recurrence rate exceeds 50%. Ten to 50% of superficial tumors will progress to invasive disease. Multifocal and recurrent tumors are usually treated with intravesical chemotherapy in addition to transurethral resection. Agents commonly employed include thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. Alternatively intravesical immunotherapy has been successfully performed with installation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin). Locally advanced tumors are usually treated with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Radiation therapy has been employed but is associated with a high rate of local recurrence.",

        "explanation": "Renal cell carcinoma or hypernephroma account for approximately 2% of all cancers diagnosed annually. It is most common after the fifth decade of life and has a male to female ratio of approximately 2:1. No definite etiology has been identified, but a frequent genetic abnormality detected in renal cell cancer is the loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3p. Multifocal bilateral tumors are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Renal carcinomas can produce a variety of hormone or hormone-like substances (e.g., erythropoietin, renin, and parathormone) and may present with a variety of symptoms including anemia, hypertension, fever and erythrocytosis. Excretory uroraphy (IVP) provides a good renal image with superior detail of the collecting system. Renal masses such as benign cysts or renal cell carcinomas will both appear as “tumor deformities”, distorting the renal outline or the collecting system. Renal cysts are far more common than renal cell carcinoma and the diagnosis can be confirmed by renal ultrasound. Surgical excision remains the primary mode of treatment for renal cell carcinoma. Although the need for radical nephrectomy has recently been questioned, this procedure remains a gold standard against which less radical procedures must be judged. Radical nephrectomy is performed through an abdominal or a thoracoabdominal approach and involves early control of the renal artery and vein. The tumor, together with the kidney and the perirenal fat is excised within Gerota’s fascia which is not opened. Less radical approaches have been suggested for the treatment of smaller tumors, including partial nephrectomy. This approach is especially valuable for bilateral tumors or in patients with a solitary kidney or poor overall renal function.",

          "C"

        "explanation": "Testis cancer is most common between the ages of 25 and 34 and is rare in blacks. The most common malignant neoplasm of the testis arise from the germ cells and can represent a variety of histologic manifestations, e.g, choriocarcinoma, embryonal cell carcinoma, seminoma, and teratoma. For therapeutic purposes, the tumors can be divided into seminomas and nonseminomas. The usual presenting symptom is testicular enlargement that may be associated with mild discomfort. Any solid testicular mass should be considered suspicious for testis carcinoma. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach for any suspected testis carcinoma is inguinal exploration with orchiectomy if the operative findings confirm the presence of a testicular mass. The inguinal approach is employed to perform high ligation of the cord at the inguinal ring and to eliminate potential involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes which are the primary area of drainage for the scrotum. The tumor markers, a-fetoprotein (AFP) and the b-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) can contribute to both diagnosis and follow-up of testis cancer. Tumor markers are helpful when obtained prior to and following orchiectomy to help in assessing the stage of the tumor. Pure seminoma does not cause elevated AFP but can produce a moderate rise in HCG in 10% of patients. Seminomas are very responsive to radiation. Patients with minimal to moderate tumor burden (Stage I or II) are usually treated with radiotherapy. The field of treatment encompasses the para-aortic and para-caval areas below the diaphragm and ipsilateral inguinal and pelvic areas. When bulky retroperitoneal and/or distant metastases are present, cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is the preferred treatment. The treatment of non-seminomatous tumors is more controversial. Stage I tumors are effectively treated with retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. If bulky stage II and stage III non-seminomatous tumors are present, initial treatment includes cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Evidence for residual disease with normalization of tumor markers is usually an indication for surgical exploration.",

        "explanation": "The prototypic bladder outlet obstruction is prostatic hyperplasia, which urologists once visualized as a progressive encroachment on the urethral lumen related to prostatic growth. It is now clear that prostatic size has no consistent relationship to obstruction and the diagnosis of obstructive uropathy cannot be made by endoscopic inspection or by determination of prostatic size or appearance. Obstruction results in progressive increases in bladder pressure and decreased urine flow rates. If bladder pressures are high enough and sustained long enough, the ureteral pump mechanism is overcome, the ureter dilates, and by a hydraulic mechanism, intervesicular pressure is transmitted to the renal pelvis. At a pressure of 42–50 cm H2O, glomerular filtration ceases. These relatively simple sequential events lead to renal failure. Prostatic enlargement clearly has an endocrine basis since treatment with a 5 a-reductase inhibitor, which blocks conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the active male hormone in the prostate) can induce a 30% to 50% regression in prostatic size. Although surgery or hormone therapy may be effective in initiating reversal of changes associated with obstructive uropathy, this does not occur invariably. Removal of the hyperplastic glandular tissue is the most effective treatment in terms of relief of symptoms. Patients who cannot be subjected to operation, however, show the same response to intermittent catheterization and periodic bladder emptying in terms of symptoms as well as bladder wall and pressure changes.",

Caucasians have between a two to tenfold higher incidence of renal stone disease than Blacks or Asians. The peak incidence of lithiasis appears to be between the ages of 45 and 64 years. Almost 3/4 of stones are composed of calcium oxalate in combination with calcium phosphate. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) or infection stones make up approximately 12% whereas pure calcium phosphate and uric acid stones each compromise 7%. The diagnosis of renal stones is made with appropriate history and performance of urinalysis and a non-contrast abdominal radiograph. Urinalysis of a patient with a urinary stone will have evidence of either gross or microscopic hematuria in 85%-95% of patients. Eighty-five to 90% of urinary stones are radio-opaque. Uric acid stones are typically not radio-opaque. The majority of stones will pass spontaneously with aid of increased hydration and appropriate analgesics. All stones passed should be retrieved for subsequent analysis. Patients passing their first stone should have serum calcium and creatinine levels and a urinalysis in addition to stone analysis. If the stone is calcium oxalate and the serum calcium level is normal, no further evaluation is necessary other than encouraging the patient to increase fluid intake. Any patient with stones composed of uric acid, pure calcium phosphate, cystine, or struvite are at high risk for continued stone formation and should undergo more extensive metabolic evaluation. In addition, those patients with recurrent or enlarging stones, including those patients with known calcium oxalate stones, should undergo a metabolic evaluation.",

        "explanation": "Erectile dysfunction is a common condition that affects 10 million American men. The incidence increases with age. By age 55 about 8% of men are affected. By the age of 80 years, the incidence is 75%. Impotence ensues from interference with the normal vascular, neurologic, psychological, endothelial, and hormonal mediators of erection. In many cases, the causes are multi-factorial. Psychological factors can inhibit as well as stimulate erection and account for less than half of the cases of impotence. Although a number of systemic diseases can cause impotence, diabetes is the most common. Impotence may also result from systemic neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Direct trauma to the pelvic nerves by pelvic fractures of radical pelvic surgery (radical prostatectomy, abdominal perineal resection) may also be associated with impotence. The determination of the effect of vascular disease on impotence can be determined through a number of techniques. An estimate of penile blood flow can be made through Doppler determination of penile systolic blood pressure using a penile cuff. Direct corporal injection with papaverine, a smooth muscle relaxant, bypasses psychogenic and neurologic factors and produces an erection if the blood flow to the penis is normal. If arterial disease is suspected on the basis of poor response, superselective pelvic arteriography with injection of vasoactive agents is necessary to document the nature of the disease. The treatment of impotence depends on both the cause and the patient’s willingness to pursue various therapeutic approaches. Patients with neurogenic impotence, such as following pelvic nerve injury, can experience dramatic results with papaverine injection. Penile implants can be used to treat any type of intractable impotence, but they are usually reserved for patients with diabetes or vascular neurologic dysfunction who do not respond to conservative measures.",

        "explanation": "Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most common non-cutaneous malignant tumor in men, accounting for 20% of all male cancers and is the second highest cause of cancer deaths in males. It is primarily a disease of older men. At autopsy, about 10% of men in their 50’s can be shown to have small latent tumors, and with this number increasing to 70% of men in their 80’s. However, it is estimated that only 10% of men over 65 will develop clinically significant prostate cancer. An increased incidence in American blacks has been reported. Early prostate cancer has few symptoms. Therefore, early diagnosis requires detection of small tumors within the prostate gland. Three modalities are used in the early detection of prostate cancer. These include digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and transrectal ultrasound of the prostate. Prostate tumors usually arise in the posterior lobe of the prostate an area readily palpable on digital rectal examination. Early prostatic cancer frequently presents as a small firm nodule within or at the periphery of the gland. If a 1 cm nodule is detected, it is cancer about 50% of the time. Prostatic biopsy is readily performed with little morbidity and is often required to confirm the diagnosis. Transrectal ultrasound of the prostate may also detect prostate cancer often as a smaller more subtle lesion not easily discernable on rectal examination. However, digital examination will also disclose some cancers that are not visualized with ultrasound. Serum PSA is used to aid in the early detection of prostate cancer. PSA is elevated in 68% of men with cancer but 33% of men with benign enlargement of the gland also have an enlarged PSA. Serum prostatic acid phosphatase is not specific for prostatic cancer although a significant elevation is usually associated with metastatic disease. Serum acid phosphatase however has been generally replaced as a tumor marker by the immunoassay for PSA. PSA is also an extremely sensitive tumor marker for recurrences after surgery because serum levels should be undetectable if patients are tumor-free.",

Depending on the magnitude of the embolism, most patients show the clearing at the end of a month to 6 weeks. The presence of persistent congestive heart failure, chronic infection, and atelectasis retard thrombolysis. This dissolution of emboli is generally agreed to be caused by naturally circulating thrombolysins. In fewer than 1% of cases the emboli persist and often increase with the passage of time, with the development of chronic pulmonary embolism leading to severe respiratory insufficiency, chronic cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death. The majority of patients with pulmonary embolism are managed by continuous intravenous heparin. Thrombolytic agents are generally reserved for the management of extensive thromboembolism in patients with a stable cardiovascular system. Thrombolytic agents are generally withheld from postoperative patients until at least the fifth postoperative day, or preferably later. Earlier administration of these agents is apt to produce bleeding at the operative site. While it may occasionally be indicated to proceed earlier, it is generally best to wait until the thrombi in the vessels divided at the time of the surgical procedure have become organized.",

NO is synthesized from the conversion of L-arginine to citrulline by at least two categories of enzymes— constitutive nitric oxide synthases (cNOS, predominantly membrane bound) and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS, predominantly cytosolic), both of which are calcium- and calmodulin dependent. Constitutive NOS is present in endothelial cells, and following cytokine stimulation endothelial cells also synthesize iNOS. In addition to its basic barrier function, the endothelium regulates intravascular coagulation by three other separate, but related, mechanisms: participation in procoagulant pathways, inhibition of procoagulant proteins, regulation of fibrinolysis and production of thromboregulating compounds. There is a local renin-angiotensin system in the vessel wall of both vein and arteries, and this system is considered important in the maintenance of blood pressure, the control of hypertension, and the response of the vessel wall to injury. In contrast to the macrocirculation, the microcirculation has distinctive vasomotor characteristics. Vessels of the microcirculation are the conduits that are responsible for the local delivery and transfer of cell substrates and metabolites. The endothelium regulates the microvasculature, reacting to the metabolic needs of tissue; it is essential in organ autoregulation and in the responses of these microvasculatures to changes in local blood flow. Reactive hyperemia appears to be dependent on the immediate production of endothelium-derived cyclo-oxygenase products, predominantly prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), as opposed to PGI 2, in the short term.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: Smooth muscle cells are the principal cells found in the media of a vessel. They are embedded in a matrix of connective tissue elements and provide mechanical and structural support to the vessel. In addition to their vasoreactive characteristics, smooth muscle cells are capable of synthesizing and secreting elements of the extracellular matrix, particularly proteoglycans. The exact mechanisms whereby smooth muscle cell proliferation is initiated, controlled, reduced, and eventually suppressed are not fully understood. Quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells are well-differentiated cells characterized by an abundance of contractile proteins, predominantly smooth muscle cell actin and myosin but little rough endoplasmic reticulum. Once activated, smooth muscle cells lose their differentiated state, acquire abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and commence the synthesis of extracellular matrix. After cytokine stimulation, smooth muscle cells synthesize iNOS and produce nanomoles of NO for at least 24 hours. Smooth muscle cell proliferation depends on the presence of PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 acts as a progression factor for PDGF in smooth muscle cells, and both in vivo and in vitro there is synergism between these two growth promoters. Smooth muscle cell growth in the wall can be modulated by various extracellular matrix substances such as collagen (type V), several glycoproteins, and the glycosoaminoglycans. Both NO and prostacyclin inhibit cell proliferation. Intimal hyperplasia is a structural lesion that develops in injured blood vessels after injury and is the result of smooth muscle cell migration into and proliferation within the intima of a blood vessel.",

Gradual occlusion over several days with a Crutchfield clamp can be used in the rare instance when resection and restoration of flow cannot be performed. Reports from the first part of this century indicate that observation of symptomatic carotid aneurysms yielded a high incidence of stroke and subsequent death. The preferred management of carotid aneurysms is resection and either reanastomosis of the internal and common carotid arteries or interposition graft replacement. Large aneurysms frequently require interposition grafting. Most aneurysms can be removed successfully, and flow can be re-established by reanastomosis. Currently, this is being achieved with a combined operative stroke and mortality rate of less than 2%.",

Carotid duplex scanning has its greatest value in the assessment of asymptomatic patients who have cervical bruits. In that circumstance, it can provide information on which the decision for further workup can be based. When symptoms suggest a transient ischemic attack, no noninvasive study provides a complete evaluation and arteriography is mandatory. EEG is a valuable test for evaluating patients when seizure activity is suspected. In this patient, an EEG would be valuable only if all other diagnostic studies had been unrevealing. An arteriogram is mandatory in this patient to adequately evaluate the entire extracranial and intracranial cerebral circulation. If a duplex scan had been performed and had revealed no disease, an arteriogram would still be necessary to exclude brachiocephalic trunk disease as a source of emboli. Likewise, intracranial narrowing would also be missed by such a noninvasive study. For these reasons, duplex scanning might be considered redundant and inadequate in these circumstances. CT of the head would be imperative in the evaluation of this patient. Its primary role is to exclude cerebral infarction, even in the presence of transient symptoms. It also distinguishes an ischemic cerebral event from an intracranial hemorrhage and rules out other potential causes of the symptoms, such as a brain tumor, other space-occupying intracranial lesions, and arteriovenous malformation.",

        "explanation": "DISCUSSION: The collateral network to the brain is extensive. Collateral flow to an area supplied by a carotid artery is provided by the contralateral carotid artery and vertebrobasilar system around the circle of Willis, by the external carotid artery branches around the eye, and by direct intracerebral connections between the anterior cerebral arteries. For these reasons, low-flow cerebral symptoms are extremely rare, even when carotid lesions are present bilaterally. Approximately 70% of all cerebral symptoms produced by carotid artery occlusive disease are embolic in origin. The surface of an atherosclerotic lesion at the carotid bifurcation is thrombogenic and acts as a nidus for the accumulation of platelet-rich thrombi. Similarly, the interior of the plaque can degenerate and rupture into the lumen, embolizing its contents into the distal bed of the carotid circulation. The final event in the progression of an atherosclerotic carotid lesion is total thrombosis. Because there are no extracranial branches of the internal carotid artery, the thrombus propagates distally. If the propagation of the clot stops at the first major intracranial branch (the ophthalmic artery) and does not disturb collateral flow through it, no cerebral ischemic event may occur. When propagation continues into the intracranial branches, a massive stroke may occur. This mechanism accounts for a minority of strokes.",

Most patients with this phenomenon are asymptomatic, although limb weakness and paresthesias or symptoms of vertebral basilar insufficiency may occur.

Renal insufficiency is more likely. The mortality averages 1%, but higher rates are reported.",

PTA of iliac lesions is technically successful in approximately 90% of patients with 3-year patency rates of approximately 80%. PTA of superficial femoral artery lesions is technically successful in 75% to 85% of patients with 3-year patency rates of approximately 60% to 70%. PTA of infrapopliteal vessels is associated with increased risk of vasospasm, which can cause thrombosis. Improvements in the technique and pharmacologic treatment of vasospasm have reduced the risk of vessel thrombosis to less than 10%. Although some series have reported PTA of infrapopliteal lesions in patients with claudication, most authors recommend treating only patients with threatened limbs. Ideal patients for PTA are those with stenotic lesions less than 5 cm. long; the best results occur in the shortest lesions. Although total occlusions and multiple stenoses have been treated successfully, there are fewer technical successes, and long-term patency rates are substantially lower than in the treatment of stenotic lesions.",

When it is technically feasible, major branches should be explored. The embolectomy balloon is made of a distensible elastomer that conforms to the intra-arterial surface to maintain wall contact. Dilatation balloons, in contrast, are made of a nondistensible material that can effect dilating force on the arterial narrowing.

The number of cases in the United States has decreased markedly since World War II, but the incidence is much higher in other countries, particularly in the Far East. Although thromboangiitis obliterans often results in peripheral gangrene and may necessitate amputation, long-term life expectancy differs little from that for the general population, unlike that of atherosclerosis. Although rare instances of thromboangiitis obliterans have been reported in nonsmokers, the most common cause is cigarette addiction, which usually starts at an early age. Prolonged remissions often follow cessation of smoking.",

The other factor that makes this unlikely to be vasospasm is the involvement of only two fingers. Because of the possibility of a surgically correctable upstream vascular lesion such as a subclavian aneurysm, patients presenting with embolic-type lesions should have arteriography. Thus this patient, presenting with ischemia of sudden onset in just two digits, should undergo arteriography. Coagulation abnormalities such as antithrombin-III, protein C, or protein S deficiency, or the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies or the lupus anticoagulant, may cause digital gangrene. Conservative therapy—local wound care and débridement—leads to healing in most patients. Sympathectomy should be reserved for patients who fail to heal after months of conservative therapy.",

Unlike most syndromes of ischemia due to atherosclerosis (coronary, cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular), chronic mesenteric ischemia occurs more frequently in women. The long-term success rates for mesenteric bypass and mesenteric endarterectomy are equivalent; either technique is acceptable. While duplex scanning is a useful noninvasive screening technique in these cases, arteriography is required for definitive diagnosis and to plan revascularization. While prospective, natural history studies have not been done, an increased risk of intestinal infarction is undeniable in these patients. When this occurs, patients rarely survive.

A history of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms is most often seen in patients with mesenteric thrombosis. Although cardiac arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation (which predispose to mesenteric emboli) may be treated with digitalis, this has no causative role in mesenteric embolism. Digitalis use has been associated with the development of “nonocclusive” mesenteric ischemia. Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase or urokinase has been used successfully to treat mesenteric emboli; however, patients with any signs of local or generalized peritonitis should have immediate surgical exploration. Mesenteric emboli usually lodge distally in the main superior mesenteric artery beyond the first jejunal branches and the origin of the middle colic artery.

The frequency of the sound is changed in proportion to the velocity of moving particles (red blood cells) and the cosign of the angle of insonnation that the beam makes with the velocity vector. The frequency shift is in the audible range and listening with a pocket Doppler provides a quick and simple method of assessing blood flow. Spectral analysis with frequency on the vertical axis, time on the horizontal axis and amplitude changes indicated by an increasing intensity on the grey scale provides considerably more information, particularly with respect to flow disturbance which produce a broadening of the normally narrow bands of frequencies which parallel the flow envelope.",

Other factors, such as a sedentary life style, aggressive high stress (Type A) behavior and alcohol use are much less clear. The metabolic traits are primarily hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and homocystinemia. Neither the metabolic or the behavioral factors appear to have a threshold effect, rather there is a progressive increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease with each level of hypertension, plasma cholesterol and number of cigarettes smoked. With the exception of cigarette smoking which directly injures the arterial wall, personal behaviors that increase cardiovascular risk seem to do so by modifying metabolic parameters. Increased physical activity may decrease the risk by improving the resting blood pressure and lipid profiles. Likewise a reduction in Type A behavior may reduce blood pressure.
